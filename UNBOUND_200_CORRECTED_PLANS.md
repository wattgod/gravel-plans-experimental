# Unbound 200 - Corrected Simplified 5-Plan Structure

## ✅ CORRECTIONS MADE

### 1. Plan Naming & Philosophy Fixed

**❌ BEFORE (Incorrect):**
- Plan 1: "Finisher" - HIIT-focused (WRONG - two Finisher plans)
- Plan 2: "Finisher Plus" - Balanced HIIT + endurance

**✅ AFTER (Corrected):**
- **Plan 1: Time Crunched (12 weeks)**
  - **Philosophy**: HIIT-Focused (Survival Mode)
  - **Target**: 0-5 hrs/week
  - **Goal**: Finish the race
  - **Replaces**: Ayahuasca Beginner, Ayahuasca Intermediate
  - **Source Plans**: "1. Ayahuasca Beginner (12 weeks)", "2. Ayahuasca Intermediate (12 weeks)"

- **Plan 2: Finisher (12 weeks)**
  - **Philosophy**: Traditional Pyramidal (NOT HIIT)
  - **Target**: 5-8 hrs/week
  - **Goal**: Finish confidently, learn proper training, build durable aerobic base
  - **Replaces**: Finisher Beginner, Finisher Intermediate
  - **Source Plans**: "5. Finisher Beginner (12 weeks)", "6. Finisher Intermediate (12 weeks)"

### 2. Nate's Workout Generator Dimensions Now Incorporated

**✅ Cadence Prescriptions by Archetype:**
- VO2max intervals: 90-100rpm (high turnover for VO2max efficiency)
- Threshold work: 85-95rpm (race cadence)
- SFR/Force: 50-60rpm (force development)
- Mixed climbing: 70-80rpm (climbing simulation)
- Tempo/G-Spot: 85-95rpm (sustainable rhythm)
- Endurance: Self-selected (comfortable endurance cadence)

**✅ Position Guidance:**
- VO2max: Seated, hoods (stable power platform)
- Threshold: Seated, drops or hoods (race position)
- Mixed climbing: Seated, hoods (climbing efficiency)
- Tempo: Alternating hoods/drops (position practice)
- Endurance: Alternating (comfort and position practice)
- Race simulation: Race position (full race gear)

**✅ In-Saddle vs Out-of-Saddle:**
- Most intervals: Seated (power efficiency)
- Stomps: Seated to standing (power development)
- Climbing: Seated, hoods (climbing efficiency)
- Endurance: Alternating positions

**✅ Durability Workouts:**
- **Structure**: Long Z2 ride FIRST → THEN intervals while fatigued → possibly more Z2
- **Purpose**: Building ability to perform intervals when already tired (race simulation)
- **Example**: "First 90 min Z2 → 3x15 min @ 87-92% FTP → Final 60 min Z2"
- **Why it matters**: In a 12-16 hour race, you need to push hard after hours of riding
- **Position guidance**: 
  - Z2 sections: Position alternation every 30 min (drops ↔ hoods)
  - Intervals: Position as specified for interval type

**✅ Archetype-Specific PURPOSE:**
- Each workout includes PURPOSE section explaining:
  - What the workout develops
  - Why it matters for race performance
  - Level-specific context (Level 1-6 progression)

## WORKOUT DIMENSIONS INCORPORATED

### From Nate's Workout Generator:

1. **Cadence Prescriptions**
   - Automatically added to quality sessions
   - Archetype-specific (VO2 = 90-100rpm, SFR = 50-60rpm, etc.)
   - Endurance rides get "self-selected" guidance

2. **Position Guidance**
   - Quality sessions: Specific position (seated, hoods, drops)
   - Endurance rides: Alternating position guidance
   - Durability workouts (≥90 min): 30-min rotation (drops ↔ hoods)

3. **In-Saddle vs Out-of-Saddle**
   - Most intervals: Seated (power efficiency)
   - Stomps: Seated to standing (power development)
   - Climbing: Seated, hoods (climbing efficiency)

4. **Durability Workouts**
   - Long endurance rides (≥90 min) get:
     - Position alternation every 30 minutes
     - Aero practice (drops) + power practice (hoods)
     - Critical for 12-16 hour race efforts

5. **PURPOSE Section**
   - Each workout explains what it develops
   - Why it matters for race performance
   - Level-specific progression context (1-6)

6. **Archetype Detection**
   - Automatically detects workout type from name
   - Applies appropriate cadence, position, and PURPOSE

## EXAMPLE WORKOUT OUTPUT

### Quality Session (VO2max Intervals):
```
WARM-UP:
• 15min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 5x4min @ 110% FTP (4min recovery)
• Cadence: 90-100rpm (high turnover for VO2max efficiency)
• Position: Seated, hoods (stable power platform)

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
VO2max development. Maximum aerobic power—the engine that drives race-winning attacks and sustained high-intensity efforts.

Level 2: Building volume. Same pattern, more work. The fitness is in the accumulation.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT ACCLIMATIZATION (Weeks 6-10):
Complete this quality session in COOL conditions (preserve workout quality). After workout, add heat exposure...
```

### Durability Workout (Long Endurance):
```
WARM-UP:
• 10min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 180min @ 68% FTP
• Position: Alternating - Alternate every 30 min: 30 min drops (aero) → 30 min hoods (power)
• Cadence: Self-selected - Comfortable endurance cadence

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Aerobic base building. Easy riding builds mitochondrial density and fat oxidation—the foundation everything else rests on.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT ACCLIMATIZATION PROTOCOL (Weeks 6-10):
This endurance ride is ideal for heat training. Choose ONE option...
• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - AGGRESSIVE FUELING:
Target 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on dress rehearsal)...
• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle)...
```
