 - Race-specific gear list (HTML formatted)
  Practice descending, cornering, and rough terrain handling.

 - Technical skills needed
  Start conservatively. Fuel early and often. Be patient on climbs.

 - Race strategy notes

TRAINING PHILOSOPHY:
  Heat adaptation takes 2-3 weeks. Starting too late means racing unprepared in dangerous conditions.

 - Why power meter is essential
  Technical skills prevent crashes and save energy. Poor handling wastes watts and increases risk.

 - Why heart rate monitor matters
  This tests nutrition, pacing, and mental preparation. Skipping it means discovering problems on race day.

 - Why bike fit is critical
  Consistency is the foundation of adaptation - skip weeks, lose gains

 - Why commitment matters
  The plan works if you work it - modifications undermine the system

 - Why following the plan matters

SKILL EXAMPLES (race-specific):
  Emergency Repairs - Fifth technical skill name
  Mechanical issues will happen. Knowing how to fix them keeps you racing. A flat tire at mile 150 doesn't have to end your day---if you can fix it quickly. A dropped chain doesn't have to cost you 10 minutes---if you've practiced the fix. The difference between finishing and DNF often comes down to mechanical competence. You can't control when mechanicals happen, but you can control how prepared you are to handle them.

 - Why this skill matters
  Practice changing tubes under time pressure: set a timer, change a tube, aim to beat your previous time. Practice fixing dropped chains: intentionally drop your chain, then fix it quickly. Learn to use tire plugs: practice inserting plugs into a punctured tire. Know your quick-link: practice breaking and rejoining your chain. Test your multi-tool: make sure every tool works before race day. Practice in conditions similar to race day: cold hands, tired, stressed. Build a troubleshooting decision tree: flat = tube or plug? Chain break = quick-link. Derailleur hanger bent = straighten or replace? Spoke break = true wheel or ride carefully? The goal isn't perfection---it's competence under pressure.

 - How to practice it
  Carry tools. Know your bike. Practice fixes. Mechanicals are when, not if.

## 1 · Training Plan Brief

          Welcome to your **Unbound Gravel 200** training plan. 200 miles with 11,000 feet of climbing through Emporia, Kansas. This isn't a race you survive by accident. It's a race you prepare for—or it prepares you for a very long day.

          
### What the Course Is Like

          The Unbound Gravel 200 covers 200 miles with 11,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain through varied terrain—this is a moderate handling challenge. Climate is the silent killer—hot. Starting elevation is around 1,200 feet, so altitude isn't a factor. The race is well-supported with aid stations. The adventure factor is moderate

          
### Why This Race Matters

          Unbound Gravel 200 is a significant gravel race—Unbound Gravel 200 is gravel cycling. The organization is flawless, the course is legendary, and the event execution sets the industry standard. The energy, the field, the community—this is what gravel racing aspires to be. Thousands of riders create incredible camaraderie, and the volunteers make it unforgettable. The field depth is unmatched—the pros, the weekend warriors, and everyone in between. Entry fees are premium, but you get what you pay for. Travel and lodging in Emporia, Kansas aren't cheap, but manageable with planning.

          
### What It Takes to Finish

          You'll be out there 10-15 hours. Base fitness alone won't cut it—you need specific preparation for sustained output. Heat acclimatization isn't optional. Endurance pacing is critical—smooth power wins over surges. Bike handling confidence at speed, especially in groups. Equipment reliability—mechanical issues end races.

          
### This Plan Prepares You for All of It

          Every workout, long ride, and recovery week is designed around Unbound Gravel 200's specific demands. Heat adaptation protocols. Endurance pacing for race distance. Technical handling for varied terrain. Mental training for when it all falls apart.

By the time you roll to the start, you'll know you're ready.

## What Makes This Plan Different

          
### Unbound Gravel 200 – AYAHUASCA · Masters (50+ Plan)

          
### 1. Training Methodology Matched to Your Reality

          You're on the **Masters** plan with **0-5** hours per week in the **AYAHUASCA** tier. This specific combination determines your optimal training philosophy.

          Choosing the right training plan comes down to two variables: **What is your rider ability?** (training experience + current fitness) and **How much time do you have per week?** (volume category). That's it. These two variables create a matrix. Your plan lives at the intersection.

          Most people get this wrong because they conflate "how much time I have" with "how fit I am" or they pick based on ego instead of reality. A former Cat 2 road racer who's been off the bike for three years and can only train 5 hours per week is not the same athlete as a complete beginner who's never done endurance sports and has 5 hours per week.

          Same weekly hours. Completely different plans.

          **Your ability level (Masters)** reflects your training experience and current fitness—not one or the other, but both. You're 50+ (or 40+ with significant recovery needs) with intermediate experience. Masters plans use moderate volume, emphasize recovery, and integrate HRV monitoring for autoregulation. They acknowledge that recovery takes longer as you age.

          **Your volume category (AYAHUASCA)** is based on the hours you'll actually spend riding each week, week after week, for the full training block. Be honest. Don't count the time you wish you had—count the time you'll realistically ride. Life will interfere. Plan for 80% completion and you'll hit closer to 100%. At **~0-5 hours per week**, you're in the AYAHUASCA category. Ayahuasca plans use high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to maximize fitness from minimal time. Two to three hard sessions per week, short endurance rides, and minimal long rides (capped at 2-3 hours). Critical caveat: These plans assume you already have fitness and experience. HIIT doesn't build base fitness—it sharpens existing fitness.

          This plan is designed specifically for the intersection of Masters ability and AYAHUASCA volume. Every workout, every progression, every recovery week is optimized for this exact combination.

          
### Performance Expectations

          With 0-5 hours per week, you're building minimal viable fitness. This is survival mode training. Realistic expectations: You'll finish the race, but it will be hard. You won't be competitive, but you'll complete the distance. If you're a true beginner on an Ayahuasca plan, adjust expectations further—you're showing up underprepared and should prioritize finishing over performance.

## How This Plan Is Structured

### 12 Weeks, 4 Phases

- **Weeks 1-3: Base Phase** — Building aerobic foundation and endurance

- **Weeks 4-7: Build Phase** — Adding intensity, developing race-specific fitness

- **Weeks 8-10: Peak Phase** — Maximum training load and sharpening

- **Weeks 11-12: Taper Phase** — Reducing volume while maintaining intensity, arriving fresh

**Phase Overview – Volume & Intensity Progression**
(12-week bar chart showing training load progression across Base, Build, Peak, and Taper phases)

### Weekly Structure

## 3-4 sessions per week: 2 high-intensity intervals, 1-2 endurance rides

### Recovery Weeks

Every third or fourth week is a recovery week with 30-40% reduced volume. Recovery makes you fast. Don't skip these.

## What You Need to Succeed

### Non-negotiables:

- A power meter

- A heart rate monitor

- A bike set up correctly for gravel racing

- Commitment to the full 12 weeks

- Willingness to follow the plan as written

- TrainingPeaks Premium (so your workouts sync to your device)

- Smart trainer for indoor workouts

### A Note on Compliance vs. Perfection

You won't execute this plan perfectly. No one does.

Life happens. Work intrudes. Illness strikes. Weather doesn't cooperate. Kids need attention. That's reality.

The goal isn't perfection---it's consistency. Complete 85-90% of the prescribed workouts, and you'll arrive at ****Unbound Gravel 200**** prepared. Complete 95%+, and you'll be exceptionally prepared.

Miss multiple weeks, skip the hard workouts, or constantly substitute "easier" options, and the plan won't work. Not because the plan failed---because you didn't do it.

Be honest with yourself about compliance.

        
          
## 2 · Before You Start

## YOU NEED TO BE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO TRAIN

This should go without saying, but we'll say it anyway: training is hard. It puts considerable stress on your cardiovascular system, your musculoskeletal system, and your body's ability to recover and adapt.

Ideally, you should get a physical before starting this plan. Have regular blood work done. Be confident you're healthy enough to handle the training load prescribed here. If you have any concerns---chest pain, unusual shortness of breath, joint issues that worsen with activity, family history of heart problems---talk to a doctor before Week 1.

If you're injured, sick, or compromised in some way, don't train. Fix the problem first, then train. Training through injury doesn't make you tough---it makes you stupid. You can't out-train a broken body.

## CYCLING IS DANGEROUS

Let's be clear: cycling is dangerous. People die every day riding their bikes. Cars hit cyclists. Cyclists crash on descents. Mechanical failures happen at speed. Group rides go wrong.

The risk is real. You're accepting that risk by choosing to train and race. We're not going to pretend otherwise or sugarcoat it.

That said, you can manage the risk. Here's how:

**Don't take stupid risks.** That gravel descent at 40mph? Maybe slow down. That car approaching an intersection? Assume they don't see you. That group paceline moving too fast for conditions? Drop off the back.

**Don't antagonize vehicles.** You might technically have the right of way. You're also on a 20-pound bike versus a 4,000-pound vehicle. Physics doesn't care about traffic law. Ride defensively. Let cars pass. Don't escalate.

**Wear a helmet.** Always. No exceptions. Get a good one. Replace it after any crash.

**Use lights.** Front and rear, even during daylight. Visibility = survival.

**Ride predictably.** Signal turns. Hold your line. Don't make sudden movements. Predictable is safe.

We can't make cycling safe. We can only make you aware that it isn't, and encourage you to ride accordingly.

## Equipment Requirements

### Mandatory:

**GPS bike computer** For tracking outdoor workouts, following routes, and displaying structured workouts from TrainingPeaks.

**Power meter or heart rate monitor** You need objective data to execute the workouts correctly. Power is preferred (more precise, immediate feedback). Heart rate works but lags by 1-3 minutes.

Bike fit A poorly fitting bike will break you over 12 weeks of training and ****200 miles**** miles of racing. Invest in a professional fit if you haven't already.

**Indoor training setup** At minimum: a basic trainer and a fan. Ideally: a smart trainer that controls resistance automatically. Many key workouts are best done indoors where you control every variable.

Reliable bike Your race bike should be mechanically sound. Shifting should be crisp. Brakes should be powerful. Tires should be appropriate for ****Unbound Gravel 200****'s terrain. Don't wait until race week to discover problems.

### Recommended:

**Multiple wheelsets** Training wheels for daily use, race wheels for key workouts and race day.

**Spare bike** Mechanical issues during training shouldn't derail your plan. Having a backup bike keeps you training.

## TrainingPeaks Setup

Your training plan lives in TrainingPeaks. Once you purchase the plan, it appears in your TrainingPeaks calendar as a series of structured workouts. Each workout includes power/heart rate targets, durations, and descriptions explaining the purpose.

## To get your workouts syncing to your devices:

Go to the TrainingPeaks Upload/Sync page and follow the instructions for your specific device (Garmin, Wahoo, etc.). This will automatically push your structured workouts to your bike computer or trainer.

**Verify it's working:** After connecting, check your bike computer or trainer app. You should see upcoming workouts appear in your device's workout library. Test it with a simple workout to confirm power/HR targets display correctly.

That's it. Once synced, your workouts appear automatically before each training session.

# 3: TRAINING FUNDAMENTALS

Before you start executing workouts, you need to understand how training works at a mechanical level.

Not theory for theory's sake---practical understanding that changes how you approach every session, how you structure your week, and how you respond when your body doesn't cooperate.

This chapter builds from first principles: the adaptation cycle that drives all fitness gains, the zones that define intensity, the variables you manipulate to create training stress, the phases that organize your 12 weeks, and the philosophical approaches that match different athlete types.

Start here. Everything else makes more sense after this.

## The Foundational Model: How Adaptation Works

All training follows the same basic cycle. Understanding this cycle is the difference between training intelligently and just accumulating fatigue.

### Step 1: Stress

You apply training stress---a hard workout that exceeds your current capacity.

This creates disruption:

- Muscle fibers develop microtears

- Glycogen stores deplete

- Metabolic waste accumulates

- Cellular damage occurs

Your body registers this as a problem that needs solving.

### Step 2: Fatigue

Immediately after training, you're weaker than before you started.

Your muscles are damaged. Your fuel tanks are empty. Your nervous system is taxed. If you tested your FTP right after a hard interval session, it would be lower than your rested FTP.

This is normal. Fatigue is the signal that triggers adaptation.

### Step 3: Recovery

Given adequate rest, nutrition, and time, your body initiates repair:

- Muscle fibers rebuild

- Mitochondria multiply (more cellular power plants)

- Capillary density increases (better oxygen delivery)

- Glycogen storage expands

- Neurological efficiency improves

This takes time. The timeline depends on the magnitude of stress:

- 24-48 hours: Muscle repair, glycogen replenishment

- 3-7 days: Mitochondrial adaptation, structural changes

- 2-4 weeks: New baseline fitness, measurable performance gains

### Step 4: Adaptation (Supercompensation)

If recovery is complete, your body doesn't just return to baseline---it overshoots.

This is called supercompensation: your body builds slightly more capacity than it had before to handle similar stress more easily next time.

You're now stronger than you were before the workout.

### Step 5: Apply New Stress

Once you've adapted, you apply a slightly larger stress. The cycle repeats.

Over weeks and months, these small adaptations compound into meaningful fitness gains.

### Where It Goes Wrong

### Insufficient Stress

If the workout is too easy, there's no disruption. No problem to solve. No adaptation triggered.

You're just riding around.

### Insufficient Recovery

If you apply new stress before recovery is complete, you accumulate fatigue without adaptation.

You're digging a hole, not building fitness.

### Inconsistent Stress

If you train sporadically---heroic efforts followed by weeks off---you never compound adaptations.

You're starting over every time.

### The Practical Rules

### 1. Training stress must be adequate but not excessive

Hard enough to trigger adaptation. Not so hard you can't recover.

2. Recovery must be prioritized as much as training

Sleep, nutrition, stress management---these aren't optional. They're where adaptation happens.

3. Consistency compounds

Ten weeks of steady training beats four weeks of heroics followed by injury or burnout.

### 4. Fitness is cumulative

Every completed workout adds to the total. Missed workouts don't just subtract---they prevent compounding.

### 5. Patience is required

Meaningful adaptation takes weeks and months, not days. Trust the process.

# 4: YOUR 12-WEEK ARC

Understanding the big picture helps you navigate the individual weeks.

Your 12-week plan isn't random workouts strung together---it's a carefully structured progression designed to build the specific fitness required for ****Unbound Gravel 200****.

Here's how it breaks down:

### Phase 1: Base (Weeks 1-3)

**Goal:** Build aerobic foundation and prepare for higher intensity work

**What you're doing:** Long, steady endurance rides at Z2. Some tempo work to maintain feel for harder efforts. Focus on consistency and volume.

**Why:** Before adding intensity, you need aerobic capacity. Z2 work builds mitochondria, capillary density, and fat-burning efficiency. This is your foundation.

**How it feels:** Manageable. You're not exhausted. If you feel crushed, you're going too hard.

### Phase 2: Build (Weeks 4-7)

**Goal:** Develop race-specific fitness at G Spot intensity

**What you're doing:** Sustained efforts at 88-92% FTP. Long rides with embedded race-pace intervals. Some threshold work to raise FTP.

**Why:** This is where you build the ability to hold "uncomfortably sustainable" pace for hours. This is the core of gravel racing fitness.

**How it feels:** Hard but purposeful. You're tired but recovering. Week 6 is a recovery week---use it.

### Phase 3: Peak (Weeks 8-10)

**Goal:** Maximum training load and race simulation

**What you're doing:** Long rides approaching race distance. Big gear work. Some VO2max to maintain top-end. Week 9 recovery week.

**Why:** This is where fitness peaks. You're simulating race demands to prove you can handle them.

**How it feels:** This is the hardest stretch. You should feel the load. That's the point. Week 9 gives you a breather before Week 10's final big push.

### Phase 4: Taper (Weeks 11-12)

**Goal:** Reduce fatigue while maintaining fitness

**What you're doing:** Volume drops 30-50%. Intensity stays present but shortened. Final race prep.

**Why:** Arrive at the start line fresh, not fatigued from training. Let your body express the fitness you built.

**How it feels:** Restless. Anxious. Like you should be doing more. Resist. Trust the process.

*Note: Specific TSS and hour targets vary by tier (Ayahuasca, Finisher, Compete, Podium). See your TrainingPeaks calendar for exact weekly prescriptions.*

# 4: YOUR 6-WEEK ARC

Understanding the big picture helps you navigate the individual weeks.

Your 6-week plan isn't random workouts strung together---it's a carefully structured, compressed progression designed to maximize fitness gains in minimal time for ****Unbound Gravel 200****.

This is emergency race prep. There's no time for a traditional base phase. Every week must count.

Here's how it breaks down:

### Week 1: Assessment & Foundation

**Goal:** Establish baseline fitness and identify limiters

**What you're doing:** FTP test, power profile assessment, durability test ride. Some Z2 endurance to maintain aerobic capacity. Light intensity work to assess current fitness.

**Why:** You need to know where you are before you can build. These tests reveal your strengths and weaknesses so the remaining 5 weeks can target what matters most.

**How it feels:** Challenging but not crushing. You're testing limits, not pushing them yet.

### Weeks 2-4: Compressed Build & Peak

**Goal:** Maximum fitness gains in minimal time

**What you're doing:** High-intensity threshold and VO2max work. Race-pace intervals. Long rides with embedded race simulation. This is where you build race-specific fitness fast.

**Why:** With only 6 weeks, there's no time for gradual progression. You're hitting race intensity immediately and building the ability to sustain it. Every workout targets race demands.

**How it feels:** Hard. Purposeful. You're accumulating fatigue but also building fitness rapidly. Week 4 includes a light recovery day---use it.

### Week 5: Final Prep & Sharpening

**Goal:** Peak fitness and race readiness

**What you're doing:** Final long ride with race simulation. Sharpening intervals at race pace. Reduced volume but maintained intensity. Final tune-up efforts.

**Why:** This is your last chance to build fitness and prove you can handle race demands. You're sharpening the edge, not grinding it down.

**How it feels:** Tired but strong. You're feeling the cumulative load, but workouts should still feel doable. If you're completely cooked, back off slightly.

### Week 6: Taper & Race

**Goal:** Arrive fresh and ready

**What you're doing:** Volume drops 40-60%. Light intensity to maintain sharpness. Race openers. Final prep.

**Why:** You can't add fitness in the final week, but you can ruin it by overtraining. The goal is to arrive at the start line fresh, not fatigued.

**How it feels:** Restless. Anxious. Like you should be doing more. Resist. Trust the process. You've done the work.

*Note: This is emergency race prep. The intensity is high from the start. If you're starting from zero fitness, this plan may be too aggressive. Be honest about your current fitness level.*

# 5: TRAINING ZONES

Every workout prescription includes a zone target. Here's what they mean and how to use them.

### The Point of Zones

Zones exist to quantify intensity and give you a common language for prescribing workouts.

But here's the paradox: **the end goal of measuring intensity is to help you develop a feeling for intensity.**

That's right---you don't use power meters, heart rate monitors, and zone charts just to become enslaved to those devices. You use them to develop an intuitive sense of effort.

Why?

Because despite our best efforts, the human body remains too complex to neatly summarize with device-generated data. Your subjective feeling is infinitely more valuable than numbered outputs based on incomplete data collection, reductive models, and population-level assumptions.

You're a special snowflake.

Learn your snowflake.

### The Three Measurement Systems

### Power (% of FTP)

Most precise system. Measures actual work output in watts. Immediate feedback. Not affected by heat, hydration, caffeine, or fatigue (though your ability to produce power is). This is the gold standard.

### Heart Rate (% of HRmax)

Secondary system. Lags behind power by 1-3 minutes (time for HR to rise to match effort). Affected by heat, hydration, caffeine, stress, illness, fatigue. Still useful, especially for pacing long efforts where immediate feedback matters less.

## RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion, 1-10 scale)

Subjective. Your body's experience of the effort. Not precise. Always available. Sometimes more important than devices.

**The ultimate arbiter:** If the numbers say one thing but your body says another, trust your body.

### How to Set Your Zones

**FTP:** Use your 20-minute test result × 0.95, or use a ramp test.

**HRmax:** Use the highest HR you've hit in the past year (excluding brief spikes), or use the formula: 211 - (0.64 × age)

Example: Age 38 = 211 - 24.3 = 186 bpm

**RPE:** This is trained through practice. After a few weeks, you'll know what 7/10 feels like without thinking about it.

### The Zone Philosophies

I'm not wedded to any particular zone scheme, but these zones work because they're practical, proven, widely understood, correspond to actual energy systems, precise enough to describe all efforts, and won't confuse you when you read other training resources.

I'm using Andrew Coggan's power zones (which everyone uses), Norway's Olympia Toppen heart rate zones (used by their Olympic endurance athletes), and the standard 1-10 RPE scale.

Here's the complete chart:

## THE 7-ZONE SYSTEM

Zone
Name
% FTP
% HRmax
RPE
Feel / Description

**Z1**
**Active Recovery**
<55%
55-72%
1-2
Very easy, relaxed pace. Gentle spinning—feels like nothing. Full conversation possible. Doesn't feel like "training." Perfect for recovery spins or social rides.

**Z2**
**Endurance**
56-75%
72-82%
3-4
All-day pace—sustainable and steady. Can chat freely. Easy enough to go long but purposeful. Can speak in long sentences. **This is where you should spend MOST of your training time.**

**Z3**
**Tempo**
76-87%
82-87%
5-6
Comfortably hard. Steady pace. Breathing deeper but rhythmic. Talking in short sentences or phrases. Feels sustainable for 1-2 hours. Great for tempo blocks and long sustained efforts.

**G SPOT**
**Gravel Race Pace**
88-92%
87-92%
6-7
Uncomfortably sustainable. Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat. This is where you'll spend most of a gravel race. Breathing is controlled but deep. Can speak in short phrases but wouldn't want to. The bread and butter of gravel-specific training.

**Z4**
**Lactate Threshold**
93-105%
94-99%
7-8
Hard, controlled effort. Focused work. Can only say a few words at a time. Breathing is labored. Designed for 10-30 minute blocks. Builds your ability to produce and clear lactate.

**Z5**
**VO2max**
106-120%
92-100%
9
Very hard, heavy breathing. Near maximum. Only single words possible. Breathing is ragged; speech is nearly impossible. Efforts last 2-8 minutes. Targets max aerobic capacity.

**Z6**
**Anaerobic Capacity**
121-150%
N/A*
10
Sharp, explosive efforts—30 seconds to 3 minutes max. All-out. Legs burn, hard to breathe or talk. Builds anaerobic power and lactate tolerance.

**Z7**
**Neuromuscular Power**
>150%
N/A*
10
All-out sprints or jumps. Pure explosive power. You're not breathing hard from your lungs—your nervous system and muscles scream. Lasts only seconds. Maximum speed and skill.

**Heart rate can't respond fast enough to track Z6-Z7 efforts. Use power and RPE.*

### Critical Notes on Using Zones

1. Zones are descriptive, not prescriptive

Zones describe what you did, not a rigid target you must hit. You're targeting a range, not a precise number.

If the workout says "Z2," anywhere in 56-75% FTP counts. Don't obsess over hitting exactly 65%. Somewhere in the zone is the goal.

2. Easy means easy

Most people train too hard on easy days. Zone 2 should feel genuinely conversational. If you're breathing hard, you're in Z3.

Fix this. It's the most common training mistake.

Most common mistake in endurance training: riding "moderately hard" all the time. You need polarization---easy days truly easy (Z1-Z2), hard days truly hard (Z4-Z6). Very little time in Z3.

3. RPE is the ultimate arbiter

Power meters can lie: bad calibration, stale FTP, wrong crank length setting. Heart rate can be misleading: heat, dehydration, caffeine, illness, accumulating fatigue.

Your body doesn't lie.

If 90% FTP feels like 9/10 today when it should feel like 7/10, something's wrong. Don't push through. Back off and investigate.

Cross-reference all three metrics. When they align, you're dialed in. When they conflict, trust RPE.

4. FTP changes slowly

Don't retest every week. Your FTP isn't changing that fast.

Test Week 1. Optionally test Week 6-7 if you're curious. Test again before the race during your taper.

Zones don't need constant adjustment. Let the training work over weeks, not days.

5. Heart rate lags power

It takes 1-3 minutes for your heart rate to rise to match your power output. This makes HR less useful for short intervals but highly reliable for longer steady efforts.

Use power for short, hard efforts (Z5-Z7). Use heart rate for pacing long endurance rides (Z2-Z3).

6. Anaerobically gifted athletes are different

The percentages for Z5-Z7 assume average physiology. Some athletes---former track sprinters, BMX racers, football players---have exceptional anaerobic capacity.

For them, 121% FTP might still feel aerobic. If this is you, your coach will adjust zones individually.

For most gravel racers (endurance-focused, aerobically developed), the standard zones work fine.

### The Bottom Line on Zones

Zones are tools, not masters.

Learn them. Use them. But develop your intuition so you can ride by feel when devices fail, conditions change, or your body sends signals the numbers don't capture.

Power + Heart Rate + RPE = complete picture. When they align, you're executing correctly. When they conflict, trust your body.

# 6: WORKOUT EXECUTION

You've got a plan. You understand the fundamentals. You know what the zones mean.

None of that matters if you can't execute the workouts correctly.

Most people fail training plans not because the programming is bad but because they don't know how to translate "3×15 min @ 95% FTP" into an actual ride that builds fitness instead of just accumulating fatigue.

This chapter covers execution: how to do different workout types, what to do when things go wrong, how to adjust on the fly, and the recovery protocols that make tomorrow's workout possible.

### The Execution Gap

There's a massive gap between what's written on the plan and what actually happens.

**The plan says:** "Tuesday: 3×15 min threshold @ 95-100% FTP, 8 min recovery between intervals"

### What actually happens:

- You skip the warmup because you're running late

- Interval 1: You go out at 105% FTP because you feel good

- Interval 2: You're struggling to hold 95%, questioning your FTP

- Interval 3: You bail at 10 minutes because you're cooked

- You skip the cooldown and immediately start checking Instagram

**Result:** Incomplete workout, accumulated fatigue, no meaningful adaptation, compromised recovery for Wednesday's ride.

This chapter teaches you how to close that gap.

### Universal Execution Rules

Before we get zone-specific, here are the rules that apply to every workout:

### 1. Warm Up Properly

For endurance/tempo rides:

- 10-15 minutes Z1→Z2, progressive from very easy to comfortable

For intensity sessions (threshold, VO2max):

- 15-20 minutes Z1→Z2→Z3

- Include 3×1 min at Z3-Z4 to "open the legs"

- 2-3 minutes easy spin before first work interval

Why it matters: Cold muscles don't produce power efficiently. Skipping warmup compromises interval quality and increases injury risk.

### 2. Do the Actual Workout (Not More, Not Less)

The most common mistake: freelancing.

- "I feel great, let me do one more interval"

- "This seems too easy, I'll bump the power up"

- "Group ride showed up, I'll just do this instead"

- "I'll add some sprints at the end for fun"

**The rule:** Execute what's prescribed. Not more. Not less. Trust the plan.

Adding volume or intensity might feel productive, but it accumulates fatigue, compromises recovery, and ruins tomorrow's workout.

3. Chase Time-in-Zone, Not Hero Intervals

This applies to everything from G Spot up to VO2max.

The goal is highest average power across the entire set, not crushing the first interval then dying.

Bad execution:

- Interval 1: 320W (way too hard)

- Interval 2: 290W (struggling)

- Interval 3: 270W (barely hanging on)

- Interval 4: Failed

- Total work: 3 intervals, 293W average, incomplete

### Good execution:

- Interval 1: 300W (controlled)

- Interval 2: 300W (harder but doable)

- Interval 3: 295W (hardest one)

- Interval 4: 295W (completed strong)

- Total work: 4 intervals, 297.5W average, complete

Which built more fitness? The second one.

Start conservatively. Finish strong. Complete the set.

### 4. Stop If Power Drops >10%

Quality beats quantity.

If you can't hold target power on interval 3+, you're done. Don't accumulate junk volume.

Four quality intervals at 300W beats six degraded intervals averaging 270W.

### Zone-Specific Execution

### Z2 (Endurance) --- The Foundation

Target: 56-75% FTP, RPE 3-4, conversational

How to execute:

- Ride steady, no surges

- Should feel easy enough to go for hours

- Full sentences possible

- Nose breathing (if you can't, you're too hard)

Common mistakes:

- Drifting into Z3 because you're bored

- Turning every endurance ride into a tempo ride

- Riding with faster friends and getting pulled up

The fix: Discipline. Easy means easy. This is 70-80% of your training volume. Protect it.

### G Spot (87-92% FTP) --- Gravel Race Pace

Target: 88-92% FTP, RPE 6-7, "uncomfortably sustainable"

How to execute:

- Stay seated, control breathing

- Hard enough to hurt, easy enough to repeat

- Could talk in short phrases but wouldn't want to

- Fuel properly: 60-80g carbs/hour

Common mistakes:

- Pushing into threshold (93%+)

- Not fueling adequately

- Letting Z2 rides drift here accidentally

The fix: This is intentional race-pace work, not your default easy ride. Do it 2-3 times per week during build phase, not daily.

Success looks like: Completing all prescribed intervals, power stable within ±5%, RPE 6-7 throughout, feeling like you could do one more if forced.

## Threshold (93-105% FTP) --- FTP Development

Target: 95-100% FTP, RPE 7-8, very hard but controlled

How to execute:

- Goal: 30-60 min total time-in-zone per session

- Even intervals (2×20, 3×15, 4×12) beat one heroic 40-minute effort

- Start at 95%, build into rhythm, settle at 97-98%

- Mix terrain: flats, rollers, climbs (not only climbs)

- Recovery: 5-10 min Z1 between intervals

Common mistakes:

- Treating it like an FTP test (going all-out on interval 1)

- Only doing threshold on climbs

- Not completing the full set

The fix: Conservative start, controlled execution, complete the work.

Success looks like: All intervals completed at target, power consistent (±3%), RPE 7-8, interval 3 felt hardest but you finished strong.

## VO2max (110-120% FTP) --- Raising the Ceiling

Target: 110-120% FTP, RPE 9, gasping, burning legs, maximal but repeatable

How to execute:

- Warm-up is critical: 20-25 min progressive with 3×1 min openers

- Hit the target from the start (don't ramp up gradually)

- Full recovery between: 4-5 min Z1, heart rate must drop below 60%

> max

- Stop if power drops >10% on any interval

Common mistakes:

- Hero-ing the first interval

- Shortchanging recovery (2 min rest isn't enough)

- Doing too many intervals (6+ is usually too much)

The fix: Controlled start, full recovery, stop when quality degrades.

Success looks like: 4-5 quality intervals at target power, RPE 9 throughout, completed the set without falling apart.

      Yes - Fresh air aids recovery
    
  

### When to ride indoors:

- Interval sessions (G Spot, threshold, VO2max)

- Short workouts ( window

**Why:** Indoors, you control everything. No stoplights. No traffic. No weather. Perfect for executing precise intervals where power targets matter.

### When to ride outdoors:

- Long endurance rides (2+ hours)

- Skills practice (cornering, descending, group riding)

- Mental freshness (indoor training is mentally draining)

- Terrain-specific preparation (if your race has significant climbing)

**Why:** Outdoor riding builds skills, mental resilience, and specificity that indoor training can't replicate. Plus, it's more enjoyable.

**The balance:** Roughly 60% indoor, 40% outdoor during base/build. Shifts to 70% outdoor during peak phase when ride duration increases.

### Gravel vs Road Training

**Here's the reality:** Most of your training can happen on the road.

Fitness doesn't know the difference between pavement and gravel. Your cardiovascular system, your muscles, your metabolic adaptations---they develop the same way regardless of surface.

The "you must train on gravel to race on gravel" crowd is overstating things. If you have safe, accessible roads and limited access to quality gravel, do most of your training on pavement. You'll be fine.

**But---** and this is important---gravel-specific skills and adaptations do exist. You can't develop them entirely on smooth pavement.

### When road training is better:

**Intervals (G Spot, threshold, VO2max)** Road provides consistent surface, predictable grip, and fewer variables. You can hit precise power targets without worrying about washboard, loose corners, or sudden surface changes. For structured work where power targets matter, road is often superior.

**Safety** If your local gravel roads have heavy truck traffic, blind corners, or sketchy conditions, road might be safer. Dead athletes don't get faster.

**Efficiency** Road rides let you cover more distance in less time. If you're time-crunched and need to accumulate volume quickly, pavement is more efficient.

### When gravel is necessary:

**Skills development** Cornering on loose surfaces, descending on variable terrain, line choice through rough sections, handling washboard at speed---these require gravel. You can't learn them on pavement.

Minimum gravel time: One ride per week during base/build, two rides per week during peak phase.

**Bike handling under fatigue** Your bike handling degrades when you're tired. A 4-hour gravel ride teaches your body to maintain smooth inputs and good line choice when your brain is foggy and your arms are tired. This matters at mile 150 of your race.

**Mental adaptation** Gravel is noisier, bumpier, more mentally demanding than road. Your brain has to process more information per second---terrain changes, grip levels, line choices. This mental load is trainable, but only by actually riding gravel.

**Race specificity (final 4 weeks)** During peak phase, your longest rides should be on gravel if possible. Simulate race conditions: gravel surface, similar terrain, race-day fueling, race-day equipment. Prove to yourself and your equipment that everything works.

### The practical balance:

### Base phase (Weeks 1-3):

- Road: 70-80%

- Gravel: 20-30%

- Focus: building fitness, one gravel ride weekly for skills

> maintenance

### Build phase (Weeks 4-7):

- Road: 60-70%

- Gravel: 30-40%

- Focus: adding intensity, increasing gravel exposure gradually

### Peak phase (Weeks 8-10):

- Road: 40-50%

- Gravel: 50-60%

- Focus: race simulation, proving equipment and systems work

### Taper (Weeks 11-12):

- Road: 50%

- Gravel: 50%

- Focus: staying sharp, final systems check

### Surface-specific execution tips:

**On road:** Execute intervals precisely. Use the smooth surface to nail power targets. Build fitness efficiently.

**On gravel:** Embrace variability. Power will fluctuate more (±10-15W is normal on rough gravel). Focus on average power and RPE rather than second-by-second precision. Practice fueling, practice skills, build confidence.

**Equipment note:** If doing structured intervals on gravel, use your race wheels and tires. Prove they work. If doing high-volume base miles on pavement, training wheels are fine---save your race equipment for when surface matters.

### The bottom line:

Don't obsess over surface. Obsess over doing the work.

If you have good gravel access, use it liberally. If you don't, do most training on road and seek out gravel for skills work and final race prep.

The race won't care how you trained. It will only care if you're fit, skilled, and prepared.

### When and How to Modify Workouts

### When modification is appropriate:

- Illness: If you're sick above the neck (head cold), reduce

> intensity by one zone. If you're sick below the neck (chest, > stomach), skip the workout entirely.

- Injury: If something hurts, stop. Continuing will only make it

> worse. Rest, recover, address the problem.

- Extreme fatigue: If you're consistently unable to hit prescribed

> power targets, you're either under-recovered or your FTP is set > too high. Take an extra rest day, then reassess.

- Life stress: Major work deadlines, family emergencies, sleep

> deprivation---these all compromise training. It's okay to reduce > volume or intensity for a week. Don't try to be a hero.

### How to modify intelligently:

- Reduce volume, not intensity: Cutting a 90-minute ride to 60 minutes

> while maintaining intervals is better than doing the full 90 at > reduced intensity.

- Substitute, don't skip: If you can't do the prescribed workout, do

> something. Even 30 minutes easy is better than nothing.

- One missed workout won't derail your plan. Two consecutive missed

> workouts should trigger a conversation with yourself about > priorities. Three consecutive missed workouts means something > fundamental isn't working---fix it before continuing.

### Recovery Protocol

Recovery isn't passive. It's active work that determines whether tomorrow's workout is productive or garbage.

### Immediately post-workout (0-30 minutes):

- 10-15 minute cooldown spin (very easy, Z1)

- Consume 20-30g protein + 60-80g carbs within 30 minutes (window is

> smaller than you think)

- Rehydrate: drink 16-24 oz of water or electrolyte drink

### Within 2 hours:

- Full meal with protein, carbs, vegetables

- Continue hydrating (urine should be pale yellow)

### Same day:

- Light movement (walk, easy spin, stretching)

- Foam rolling or massage for particularly hard sessions

- Avoid sitting for extended periods

### That night:

- 7-9 hours of sleep (non-negotiable)

- Keep room cool and dark

- Avoid screens 30 minutes before bed

### Next day:

- Assess readiness: resting heart rate (elevated = under-recovered),

> legs feel (heavy = under-recovered), motivation (low = > under-recovered)

- Adjust today's workout if needed

Recovery makes you fast. Training just provides the stimulus. Don't skip the recovery.

## HRV: What It Is, What It Isn't, and How to Use It

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is one of the most misunderstood metrics in endurance training. Some athletes obsess over it. Others ignore it entirely. Both are wrong.

Here's what you actually need to know.

### What HRV Actually Measures

HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Not your heart rate---the inconsistency in the gaps between beats.

A healthy, recovered nervous system produces variable gaps. Your heart doesn't beat like a metronome---it speeds up slightly when you inhale, slows down when you exhale, and constantly adjusts based on dozens of inputs.

Higher HRV generally indicates your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) is dominant. Your body is recovered and ready for stress.

Lower HRV generally indicates your sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is dominant. Your body is still processing stress---from training, work, poor sleep, illness, or life.

### What HRV Is Good For

### 1. Trend tracking over weeks

A single HRV reading means almost nothing. But watching your 7-day rolling average tells you something useful: is your body absorbing the training load or accumulating fatigue?

If your baseline is 65ms and you've been hovering at 55ms for two weeks, you're probably under-recovered. Time to back off.

If your baseline is 65ms and you're consistently hitting 70ms, you're adapting well. Training is working.

### 2. Confirming what your body already knows

HRV is most useful as a tiebreaker. You wake up feeling "meh"---not terrible, not great. Should you do today's hard workout or swap it for easy spinning?

Check HRV. If it's suppressed (below your baseline), that's confirmation: your body is telling you the same thing your subjective feel is telling you. Take the easy day.

If HRV is normal but you feel tired, it's probably just fatigue rather than systemic stress. You can probably push through with a proper warmup.

### 3. Catching illness early

HRV often drops 24-48 hours before you feel sick. If you see a sudden, unexplained drop of 10-15% from baseline, pay attention. You might be fighting something off.

This is actually HRV's superpower: early warning system for illness. Catching a cold early and resting can save you a week of lost training.

### What HRV Is NOT Good For

### 1. Predicting performance

High HRV this morning does not mean you'll crush your intervals today. Low HRV does not mean you'll fail.

HRV tells you about recovery status, not performance readiness. Some athletes perform great with suppressed HRV. Some have high HRV and feel flat.

Use it as one input, not the answer.

### 2. Day-to-day decision making (in isolation)

One bad HRV reading means nothing. You could have slept in a weird position, been dehydrated, had a stressful dream, or measured incorrectly.

Never cancel a workout based on one HRV reading. Look at trends over 5-7 days minimum.

### 3. Comparing yourself to others

HRV is highly individual. An elite athlete might have a baseline of 80-100ms. A stressed, under-recovered amateur might baseline at 40-50ms. Higher is generally better---it indicates a more adaptive, resilient nervous system.

But here's the thing: your HRV is only meaningful relative to YOUR baseline. An elite dropping from 90ms to 70ms is a red flag. An amateur rising from 45ms to 55ms over months of training is progress.

Comparing your number to someone else's is useless. Track your own trend.

### How to Actually Use HRV

### Step 1: Establish your baseline

Measure every morning for 2-3 weeks before drawing any conclusions. Same time, same conditions: immediately upon waking, before getting out of bed, before coffee, before phone.

Your baseline is your 7-day rolling average during normal training (not during recovery weeks or peak training).

### Step 2: Watch the trend, not the number

Daily fluctuations of 5-10% are normal. Ignore them.

Pay attention to:

- 7-day average trending down for 2+ weeks → accumulated fatigue

- 7-day average trending up → good adaptation

- Sudden single-day drop of 15%+ → possible illness or acute stress

### Step 3: Use it as a tiebreaker

  
    
      How You Feel
      HRV Status
      Action
    
  
  
    
      **Feel good**
      HRV normal/high
      Do the workout as planned
    
    
      **Feel good**
      HRV suppressed
      Do the workout, but monitor closely
    
    
      **Feel bad**
      HRV normal/high
      Extended warmup, then reassess
    
    
      **Feel bad**
      HRV suppressed
      Swap for easy day or rest
    
  

**Note:** Feel bad means genuinely fatigued, not just don't feel like it. Be honest with yourself.

### Step 4: Don't overthink it

The best athletes I know check HRV every morning, glance at the trend once a week, and otherwise ignore it.

They don't cancel workouts based on HRV. They don't celebrate high readings. They use it as background information that occasionally confirms what their body is already telling them.

That's the right relationship with this metric.

### Practical Setup

### Apps that work:

- HRV4Training (most research-backed, camera-based works fine)

- Elite HRV (good free option)

- Whoop (expensive but automatic)

- Oura Ring (convenient, sleep tracking included)

- Garmin (if you have compatible watch)

### Measurement protocol:

- Same time every morning (within 30 minutes)

- Before getting out of bed

- Before coffee, food, phone

- Lying down, relaxed breathing

- 1-3 minute measurement (depends on app)

**Consistency matters more than precision.** A cheap app used consistently beats an expensive device used sporadically.

### The Bottom Line on HRV

HRV is a useful tool for tracking recovery trends and catching illness early. It's not a crystal ball for performance or a daily decision-making oracle.

Measure it consistently. Watch the 7-day trend. Use it to confirm what your body is telling you. Don't obsess over daily fluctuations.

If your HRV, your subjective feel, and your performance in workouts all align, you're on track. If they conflict, dig deeper---something's off.

And remember: athletes trained effectively for decades before HRV apps existed. This is a helpful tool, not a requirement. If tracking HRV stresses you out more than it helps, stop tracking it and listen to your body instead.

### Strength Training: The Honest Take

Long neglected by endurance athletes, strength training has finally gotten the attention it deserves. The research is clear: stronger athletes perform better, get injured less, and extend their careers.

Here's what strength training actually does for you:

### The Performance Benefits

**Improved movement economy.** Stronger muscles require less effort to produce the same output. You become more efficient---same power, less metabolic cost.

**Better force production.** Cycling is about applying force to pedals, repeatedly, for hours. Stronger muscles generate more force per contraction. This matters most when you're fatigued and your body is looking for any available resource.

**Enhanced muscle activation.** Strength training improves your nervous system's ability to recruit muscle fibers. More fibers firing means more power available when you need it.

**Greater explosiveness.** Gravel racing isn't steady-state. It's accelerations out of corners, punchy climbs, surges to close gaps. Strength gives you the snap to respond.

**Increased training capacity.** A stronger body can absorb more training stress and recover faster. This compounds over months and years.

### The Injury Prevention Benefits

**Joint stability.** Stronger muscles stabilize joints through their full range of motion. This matters when you're bouncing over rough terrain for 8 hours.

**Muscle balance.** Cycling creates imbalances---strong quads, weak glutes, tight hip flexors, dormant core. Strength training addresses these before they become injuries.

**Resilience.** A stronger body can handle the unexpected---a crash, a weird landing, an awkward dismount. The difference between "that was close" and "I'm out for 6 weeks."

## The Health Benefits

Beyond performance, strength training improves hormone regulation, insulin sensitivity, bone density, and body composition. These matter more as you age. If you're 40+, strength training isn't optional---it's mandatory for long-term athletic health.

### Here's My Policy

## Mobility and stability work: Do it year-round.

This is non-negotiable. 10-15 minutes of targeted mobility work, 2-3 times per week, all year. Hip flexor stretches, glute activation, core stability, thoracic mobility. This is "prehab"---preventing injuries before they happen.

You don't need a gym. You don't need equipment. You need consistency.

## Full periodized strength training: This is a skill.

Here's where I'll be honest with you.

The strength periodization pyramid---Anatomical Adaptation → Muscular Endurance → Maximum Strength → Power → Maintenance---is legitimate. It works. The research supports it.

But it's a **skill** that requires:

- Time (16-20+ weeks to progress through phases properly)

- Effort (2-3 gym sessions per week, progressive overload)

- Patience (you can't rush neuromuscular adaptation)

- Knowledge (proper form, appropriate loading, periodization timing)

## You cannot start this from scratch during a 12-week race prep.

If you've never done structured strength training, trying to cram it into your race preparation is a recipe for:

- Excessive fatigue that compromises your cycling training

- Delayed onset muscle soreness that ruins key workouts

- Injury from poor form under fatigue

- Mental bandwidth overload

### What To Actually Do

## If you already have a strength training habit:

Continue it. Shift toward maintenance phase as you enter peak training (weeks 8-12). Reduce volume, maintain intensity, prioritize recovery.

Typical maintenance: 2 sessions/week, compound movements, moderate weight, 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps. Enough to preserve gains without creating fatigue.

## If you don't have a strength training habit:

Don\'t start a full program now. Instead:

- **Add mobility work immediately.** 10-15 minutes, 3x/week. Hip flexors, glutes, thoracic spine, ankles. YouTube "cycling mobility routine" and pick one you'll actually do.

- **Add basic core stability.** Planks, dead bugs, bird dogs. 10 minutes, 2-3x/week. A stable core transfers power more efficiently and protects your lower back during long rides.

- **Add bodyweight movements if you have bandwidth.** Squats, lunges, glute bridges, push-ups. No gym required. 15-20 minutes, 2x/week. This builds the foundation for future strength work.

- **Plan a proper strength block for your off-season.** After this race, commit to 12-16 weeks of structured strength training before your next build. Start with Anatomical Adaptation, progress through the phases, build the habit properly.

### The Bottom Line

Strength training makes you faster and keeps you healthy. But it's a long-term investment, not a quick fix.

During this 12-week block, prioritize:

- Mobility/stability work (non-negotiable)

- Basic core stability (highly recommended)

- Maintenance strength if you already lift (continue what you're

> doing)

Don't try to build a strength base while preparing for a race. Do one thing well, not two things poorly.

After **Unbound Gravel 200**, invest in a proper off-season strength block. Your future self---the one who's still racing at 50, 60, 70---will thank you

# 7: Technical Skills for Unbound Gravel 200

Fitness gets you to the race. Skills determine whether you use that fitness efficiently or waste it fighting your bike, crashing, or making mistakes that cost time and energy.

A technically skilled rider with moderate fitness will often outperform a fitness monster who can't corner, can't descend, or can't eat while riding. Technical competence is free speed---it requires no additional fitness, just practice.

The good news: these skills are trainable. The key is deliberate practice---focused repetition with the intention of improvement, not just miles logged while thinking about other things.

Here are the five skills that matter most for ****Unbound Gravel 200****. Practice them during training so they're automatic on race day.

### Skill 1: Loose Surface Cornering

### Why it matters:

Crashes end races. Beyond the obvious injury risk, even a minor crash costs you time, damages equipment, and rattles your confidence for the rest of the day. You'll ride tentatively for hours after a scare, losing speed on every turn.

Confident cornering also lets you maintain speed through technical sections while others slow to a crawl. Over the course of ****200 miles**** miles, those speed advantages compound significantly.

### How to practice:

Find a gravel parking lot or quiet gravel road with some turns. Start at 50% of the speed that feels comfortable---seriously, slower than you think necessary.

Focus on three things: First, look through the turn. Your bike goes where your eyes go, so look at your exit point, not at the ground in front of your wheel. Second, weight your outside pedal. Push down hard through the outside pedal---this presses the tires into the surface for better grip. Third, point your inside knee toward the turn. This shifts your weight properly and helps the bike lean.

Gradually increase speed over weeks of practice. Do this progression multiple times, not once. Practice in different conditions---dry packed gravel handles differently than loose limestone, which handles differently than wet clay-based gravel. The goal is to build a library of experience so nothing on race day surprises you.

By race day, you should be able to corner at speed without conscious thought. The skill should be automatic.

**The cue to remember:** "Eyes through, weight down, knee out"

### Skill 2: Eating While Riding

### Why it matters:

In a race lasting 8+ hours, you'll consume thousands of calories. If you can't eat while riding, you have two options: stop frequently (losing time and rhythm) or under-fuel (bonking spectacularly around mile 120).

Race-day nutrition needs to be automatic---something you do without thinking, without slowing down, without fumbling. The time to learn this is not during the race.

### How to practice:

On every training ride over 90 minutes, eat something while riding. Not during stops---while actually pedaling.

Start on flat, straight sections where the consequences of a mistake are minimal. Unwrap bars before you leave, or use products with easy-open packaging. Move food to easily accessible pockets. Fumbling in a jersey pocket while riding is a learned skill.

Practice eating with both hands. You never know which side a hazard might appear on, and you need to be able to grab food, open it, and eat it with either hand staying on the bars.

Graduate to eating on rougher terrain as you get more confident. By race week, you should be able to grab a bar from your pocket, open it, and eat it on bumpy gravel without thinking about it.

**The cue to remember:** "Flat road first, then rough. Both hands work"

### Skill 3: Group Riding & Pace Line Dynamics

### Why it matters:

Drafting---riding in another rider's slipstream---saves roughly 25-30% of the energy required to maintain the same speed. Over a 200-mile race, that's an enormous advantage. The difference between finishing strong and barely finishing.

Knowing how to find, join, and contribute to a pace group is often the difference between a good race and a great one. But you need to be the kind of rider others want in their group.

### How to practice:

Join group rides. Any group rides. The faster and more organized, the better, but any group riding teaches useful skills.

Focus on smooth, predictable movements. No sudden braking. No surging. No erratic line choices. When you take a pull at the front, maintain steady effort---don't accelerate. When you rotate off, do it smoothly and predictably, not with a sudden swerve.

Communicate about road hazards. Point at potholes. Call out cars. Wave people through when it's safe. A group that communicates well moves faster and safer than one that doesn't.

Practice maintaining a gap behind another rider---2-3 bike lengths is safe for learning. Work on holding that gap as they accelerate and decelerate. The goal is to become a rider others trust---someone who's predictable, communicates well, and does their share of the work without showing off.

If group rides aren't available or don't fit your schedule, practice following 2-3 bike lengths behind a friend at varying speeds. The skill of maintaining position transfers.

**The cue to remember:** "Smooth pulls, steady pace, speak up"

### Skill 4: Descending on Loose Gravel

### Why it matters:

Fear on descents means crawling. Crawling means getting dropped. Confidence on descents is free speed---it requires no extra fitness, just skill and experience with the bike moving underneath you.

The psychological aspect matters too. If you're terrified on descents, you'll dread them for miles beforehand. That's mental energy wasted. Confidence on descents frees mental space for other race decisions.

### How to practice:

Find a gravel descent you can repeat safely---ideally one that takes 2-3 minutes. You need somewhere you can do multiple runs without wasting time climbing back to the top.

On your first passes, go slow and focus on body position: weight shifted back (get your butt behind the saddle on steep sections), elbows bent and loose, grip relaxed. Death-gripping the bars prevents the bike from moving naturally beneath you, which actually reduces control.

Each pass, increase speed slightly. Pay attention to where you tense up---that's information about where your skills need work. Notice what happens when you brake: front brake straightens the bike and provides most of your stopping power, rear brake can skid on loose surface but won't wash out the front.

Practice braking before turns, not during them. Braking in a turn on loose gravel is a recipe for washing out the front wheel. Brake, then turn. Not both simultaneously.

Repeat this progression regularly---not once and done. Your confidence on descents is perishable. Practice maintains it.

**The cue to remember:** "Weight back, light hands, eyes up"

### Skill 5: Emergency Repairs

Why it matters:
Mechanical issues will happen. Knowing how to fix them keeps you racing. A flat tire at mile 150 doesn't have to end your day---if you can fix it quickly. A dropped chain doesn't have to cost you 10 minutes---if you've practiced the fix. The difference between finishing and DNF often comes down to mechanical competence. You can't control when mechanicals happen, but you can control how prepared you are to handle them.

How to practice:
Practice changing tubes under time pressure: set a timer, change a tube, aim to beat your previous time. Practice fixing dropped chains: intentionally drop your chain, then fix it quickly. Learn to use tire plugs: practice inserting plugs into a punctured tire. Know your quick-link: practice breaking and rejoining your chain. Test your multi-tool: make sure every tool works before race day. Practice in conditions similar to race day: cold hands, tired, stressed. Build a troubleshooting decision tree: flat = tube or plug? Chain break = quick-link. Derailleur hanger bent = straighten or replace? Spoke break = true wheel or ride carefully? The goal isn't perfection---it's competence under pressure.

**The cue to remember:** "Carry tools. Know your bike. Practice fixes. Mechanicals are when, not if.

"

### Race-Specific Skill Notes

## Practice descending, cornering, and rough terrain handling.

The bottom line on skills: You can't cram for these the week before the race. Technical skills require repetition over time. Build them into your training rides starting in Week 1, not Week 11.

By race day, these skills should be automatic. You shouldn't be thinking about how to corner or how to eat---you should just be doing it.

        
          
## 8 · Fueling & Hydration

          You can have perfect training, a dialed bike, and excellent pacing strategy. None of it matters if you run out of fuel halfway through your race.

          Nutrition determines roughly 8% of your race result. That's the difference between finishing strong and crawling to the line.

          This chapter covers what to eat, when to eat it, and how to execute nutrition under race stress when your stomach is rebelling and your brain is too stupid to remember to eat.

          
### Quick Reference: Fueling & Hydration Guidelines

            
              
                Scenario
                Carbohydrate Intake
                Fluid Intake
                Notes

            
            
              
                **Training Ride < 2 hours**
                30-45g/hour
                500-750ml/hour
                Water + electrolytes. Start fueling after 60 min if needed.

                **Training Ride 2-4 hours**
                45-60g/hour
                500-750ml/hour
                Mix of gels, bars, and real food. Practice your race nutrition.

                **Long Training Ride 4-6 hours**
                60-75g/hour
                500-750ml/hour
                Aggressive gut training. Test race-day nutrition strategy.

                **Race Day (200 miles, ~10-15 hours)**
                60-90g/hour
                500-750ml/hour
                Start fueling in first 30 min. Mix multiple carb sources (glucose + fructose).

                **Hot Conditions (>80°F)**
                60-90g/hour
                750-1000ml/hour
                Increase sodium to 500-700mg/hour. Pre-cool if possible.

                **Cold Conditions (<50°F)**
                60-90g/hour
                400-600ml/hour
                Lower fluid needs, but still fuel aggressively. Warm fluids help.

            

          

          
### The Nutrition Reality Check

          The cycling nutrition industry wants you to believe you need seventeen different products, each with proprietary blend ratios and specific timing windows measured in seconds.

          You don't.

          You need carbohydrates during exercise. You need protein and carbs after exercise. You need reasonable daily nutrition that supports training.

          That's 95% of it.

          Everything else is optimization you can worry about after you've nailed the basics.

          

          
### Daily Nutrition for Training

          Your body is either recovering from the last workout or preparing for the next one. Daily nutrition supports both.

          The Foundation
          **Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight**

          If you weigh 70kg (154 lbs), that's 112-154g protein per day.

          **Why it matters:** Protein rebuilds muscle tissue damaged during training. Skimp on protein and you're just breaking yourself down without rebuilding.

          **Sources:** Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, protein powder if you're lazy or vegan.

          **The rule:** Spread it across the day. Four meals with 25-40g each beats one massive 150g post-workout shake.

          

          **Carbohydrates: 3-7g per kg bodyweight** (depends on training volume)

          

            - Easy training days (Z2 endurance): 3-4g/kg

            - Hard training days (intervals, long rides): 5-7g/kg

            - Rest days: 2-3g/kg

          If you weigh 70kg:
          - Easy day: 210-280g carbs
          - Hard day: 350-490g carbs
          - Rest day: 140-210g carbs

          **Why it matters:** Carbs fuel high-intensity work and restock glycogen. Train hard without adequate carbs and your intervals will suck.

          **Sources:** Rice, potatoes, oats, bread, pasta, fruit. Real food first, gels and bars during rides only.

          **The rule:** Match carb intake to training load. Don't carb-load on rest days. Don't under-fuel hard training blocks.

          

          **Fat: 0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight**

          If you weigh 70kg, that's 56-84g fat per day.

          **Why it matters:** Hormones, cell membranes, vitamin absorption, satiety. Fat doesn't fuel hard efforts but it's essential for recovery and health.

          **Sources:** Olive oil, nuts, avocados, fatty fish, whole eggs, butter.

          **The rule:** Don't fear fat. Don't gorge on fat. Keep it moderate and consistent.

          

          Timing That Actually Matters
          **Pre-workout (2-3 hours before)**

          If training hard (threshold, VO2max):
          - 1-2g carbs per kg bodyweight
          - Low fiber, low fat, moderate protein
          - Example: Oatmeal with banana and honey, or toast with peanut butter

          If training easy (Z2 endurance):
          - Eat normally, don't stress timing
          - Can even train fasted if under 90 minutes

          **The rule:** Hard sessions need fuel. Easy sessions are flexible.

          

          **During workout**

          Covered in detail below. Short version: 60-80g carbs per hour for rides over 90 minutes at moderate-to-high intensity.

          

          **Post-workout (0-90 minutes after)**

          If workout was long (2.5+ hours) AND hard, AND you have another hard session within 24-36 hours:
          - 20-30g protein
          - 1-1.5g carbs per kg bodyweight
          - Liquid is fine (protein shake, chocolate milk)

          If workout was easy, short, or your next hard session is 48+ hours away:
          - Just eat your next meal normally
          - Recovery nutrition is optional

          **The rule:** The more frequently you train hard, the more critical recovery nutrition becomes. If you're training once per day with easy sessions, skip the fancy recovery protocols and just eat dinner.

          

          
### What About Supplements?

          Most supplements are placebo at best, actively harmful at worst.

          Worth taking:
          **Vitamin D (if deficient, most people are): 2000-4000 IU daily**
          - Supports bone health, immune function, recovery
          - Get your levels tested, supplement accordingly

          **Creatine monohydrate: 5g daily**
          - Improves high-intensity repeatability
          - Useful for VO2max and sprint work
          - Cheap, well-researched, safe

          **Caffeine: 3-6mg per kg bodyweight before hard sessions**
          - Proven performance enhancer
          - Coffee works, pills work, gels work
          - Tolerance builds, cycle off occasionally

          Maybe worth taking:
          **Beta-alanine: 3-5g daily**
          - Buffers lactate, helps with threshold work
          - Takes 4+ weeks to build up
          - Makes your face tingle (harmless but weird)

          **Beetroot juice/nitrates: 2-3 hours before hard efforts**
          - Improves oxygen efficiency
          - Modest gains (2-3%)
          - Tastes like dirt

          Not worth taking:
          **BCAAs (branch chain amino acids):** Complete waste if you eat adequate protein
          **Testosterone boosters:** Scams
          **Fat burners:** Scams with side effects
          **Recovery drinks with proprietary blends:** Overpriced protein+carbs

          **The rule:** If you're deficient in something (Vitamin D, iron), fix it. If you're considering a supplement to "optimize," ask yourself if you've already nailed sleep, nutrition basics, and training consistency. If not, fix those first.

          

          
### Fueling During Workouts

          This is where races are won or lost.

          The 60-80g Carbs Per Hour Rule
          For any ride over 90 minutes at moderate-to-high intensity (Z3+), you need **60-80g of carbohydrates per hour.**

          Not 30g. Not 100g. 60-80g.

          **Why this number?**

          Your gut can absorb approximately 60g of glucose per hour through SGLT1 transporters. Add fructose (which uses different transporters) and you can push to 90g total. The sweet spot for most athletes is 70-75g per hour—enough to fuel hard efforts without GI distress.

          **What 70g of carbs looks like:**

          

            - **Option 1:** 3 gels (24g each) = 72g

            - **Option 2:** 2 bottles of sports drink (35g each) = 70g

            - **Option 3:** 2 bars (40g each) = 80g

            - **Option 4:** Mix of real food + gels + drink

          **The rule:** Pick what your stomach tolerates. Train your gut to handle race-day fueling. Don't experiment on race day.

          

          Workout-Specific Fueling
          **Z2 Endurance Rides (2-4 hours)**

          

            - **Intensity:** Low enough to burn primarily fat

            - **Fueling:** 40-60g carbs per hour

          You can get away with less because you're not depleting glycogen rapidly. Real food works great here—PB&J sandwiches, bananas, bars.

          Practice eating solid food on long easy rides. This builds GI tolerance for race day.

          

          **Tempo/G Spot Rides (2-3 hours with sustained efforts)**

          

            - **Intensity:** Moderate-high, significant glycogen use

            - **Fueling:** 60-80g carbs per hour

          Start fueling at 30-45 minutes, not 90 minutes. By the time you feel hungry, you're already behind.

          Mix of liquids (faster absorption) and solids (more satisfying, prevents flavor fatigue).

          

          **Threshold/VO2max Sessions (60-90 minutes)**

          

            - **Intensity:** Very high but short duration

            - **Fueling:** Pre-workout meal sufficient, maybe one gel mid-session

          You're not depleting glycogen in 60 minutes. Don't overthink this. Hydrate normally, maybe take a gel at 45 minutes if going long.

          

          **Race Simulation Rides (4-6 hours with race-pace efforts)**

          

            - **Intensity:** Variable, high average

            - **Fueling:** 70-80g carbs per hour, practice race-day nutrition

          This is where you dial in your race fueling. Test different products, timing, combinations. Figure out what your stomach tolerates at race pace.

          **The rule:** The longer and harder the ride, the more critical fueling becomes. Easy rides are forgiving. Race-pace efforts are not.

          

          
### Hydration Protocols

          You lose 0.5-2 liters of fluid per hour depending on temperature, humidity, and effort.

          Dehydration of 2-3% bodyweight impairs performance. For a 70kg rider, that's 1.4-2.1 liters—easily achievable in 2-3 hours of hard riding in heat.

          How much to drink:
          **Aim for: 500-750ml per hour (16-25 oz)**

          More in heat, less in cold. More when sweating heavily, less when not.

          **The rule:** Drink to thirst, but don't ignore thirst. By the time you're thirsty, you're already mildly dehydrated.

          What to drink:
          

            - **Short rides (<90 min):** Water is fine

            - **Long rides (2+ hours):** Electrolyte drink with sodium

          Sodium matters on long rides. You lose 500-1000mg sodium per hour through sweat. Sports drinks provide 200-400mg per bottle. Add salt tabs if racing in heat or you're a heavy/salty sweater.

          Don't overthink potassium, magnesium, or trace minerals. Sodium is 90% of what matters for performance.

          How to verify your hydration strategy works:
Weigh yourself before and after long training rides. Every pound lost represents roughly 16 ounces of fluid deficit. If you're losing more than 2-3% of body weight during rides, you need to drink more.

          **Example:** 150-lb athlete loses 5 lbs during a 4-hour ride. That's 3.3% body weight loss and 80 oz of fluid deficit. At 4 hours, that's only 20 oz/hour consumption—too low. Target should be 32+ oz/hour to stay within 2-3% loss.

Do this calculation during training. Adjust your hydration strategy based on real data from your body. Don't guess.

          How to know if you're a salty sweater:
          After long training rides, do you see visible salt crystals on your kit or face? Do you crave salty foods immediately after rides? That's information. You need more sodium than average.

          

          
### Cramping

          Cramps are **not** caused by electrolyte deficiency (despite what the supplement industry tells you).

          Cramps are caused by **neuromuscular fatigue**—your muscles are tired and misfiring.

          Salt tabs might help by changing neuromuscular excitability, but they're not addressing the root cause. The real fix is better pacing and better training.

          

          
### Training Your Gut

          Your gut is trainable just like your muscles.

          If you never eat during training rides, your gut won't tolerate eating during races. You'll get nauseous, crampy, or shut down completely.

          The ability to absorb large amounts of carbohydrates while exercising improves with practice. If you've never consumed 80+ grams of carbs per hour during a ride, your first attempt will probably end in GI distress—bloating, cramping, or worse.

Your gut needs practice absorbing carbs while blood flow is diverted to working muscles. This is a learned adaptation.

          How to build GI tolerance:
          **Weeks 1-4 (Base Phase):**
          - Practice eating real food on easy rides
          - 40-50g carbs per hour, mostly solid
          - Build tolerance gradually

          **Weeks 5-8 (Build Phase):**
          - Increase to 60-70g carbs per hour
          - Mix of liquids and solids
          - Practice eating at tempo pace

          **Weeks 9-10 (Peak Training):**
          - Hit 70-80g carbs per hour
          - Race nutrition only (gels, drink, bars you'll use on race day)
          - Practice at race pace

          **Race Week:**
          - Stick with what worked in training
          - No new products
          - Trust your gut (literally)

          **The rule:** Your gut adapts to what you consistently ask it to do. If you train it to handle 70g carbs per hour, it will. If you never practice, race day will be miserable.

          One trick that helps: Mix glucose and fructose sources
Research shows that combining glucose and fructose (ideally in a 2:1 ratio) allows your gut to absorb more total carbohydrates per hour than either source alone. Different transporters in the intestine handle each sugar, so using both increases total capacity.

          Many sports nutrition products are already formulated this way. Check the labels. If you're making your own drink mix, consider combining sources—like maltodextrin (glucose) with table sugar (glucose + fructose).

          

          
### Race-Day Nutrition Strategy

          Everything you practiced in training gets executed under stress.

          Pre-Race Meal (3-4 hours before start)
          **Goal:** Top off glycogen, don't experiment

          **What to eat:**
          - 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight
          - Moderate protein
          - Low fat, low fiber
          - Familiar foods only

          **Example for 70kg rider:**
          - 2 cups oatmeal with banana and honey (140g carbs)
          - OR 3 pieces toast with jam and peanut butter (120g carbs)
          - OR large bowl of rice with eggs (130g carbs)

          Drink 500ml water with your meal.

          **What not to do:**
          - Try the complimentary breakfast burrito with hot sauce
          - Drink coffee if you don't normally drink coffee
          - Eat significantly more or less than you practiced

          

          Starting Line (30-60 minutes before start)
          Take one gel (24g carbs) with 200ml water.

          This tops off your tank right before the effort begins. You're not adding meaningful glycogen at this point—you're just making sure blood glucose is stable as the race starts.

          

          During the Race: The Fueling Timeline
          **The most common mistake:** waiting until you're hungry to start eating.

          By the time you feel hungry, your glycogen is already depleted and your brain is glucose-starved. You're in a hole you can't climb out of.

          **The execution framework:**

          **0-30 minutes:**
          - Focus on pacing, positioning, settling in
          - Sip on drink, don't force nutrition yet
          - Heart rate is spiking, gut blood flow is reduced

          **30-60 minutes:**
          - First gel or equivalent (24g carbs)
          - Start your fueling clock
          - Hydrate consistently

          **Every 45-60 minutes after:**
          - Consume 60-80g carbs per hour in consistent intervals
          - **Example:** Gel every 45 minutes (24g × 4 = 96g per 3 hours, averaging 32g per hour—too low, need drink or bars too)
          - **Better example:** Gel every 30 minutes (24g × 2 = 48g per hour) + drink with 30g per hour = 78g total

          **Set a timer.** Seriously. Your brain will be stupid. It will forget to eat. It will lie to you and say "I'm fine, I'll eat at the next aid station." The timer removes decision-making.

          **At aid stations:**
          - Top off bottles
          - Grab food if needed
          - Keep moving

          Don't stop for 5 minutes eating a ham sandwich. Grab and go. You're not on a picnic.

          

          
### When Your Stomach Rebels

          It will. At some point in a long race, your gut will protest.

          **Why it happens:**

          High-intensity exercise diverts blood from your GI system to working muscles. Your gut slows down. Food sits there, undigested, making you feel like shit.

          **What to do:**

          **1. Back off intensity for 5-10 minutes**
          - Drop to Z2 pace
          - Let gut blood flow recover
          - Allow stomach to catch up

          **2. Switch to liquid calories temporarily**
          - Easier to digest than solids
          - Sports drink or cola at aid stations
          - Gels if you can tolerate them

          **3. Small sips, not big gulps**
          - Easier on the stomach
          - Less sloshing

          **4. Don't panic and stop eating entirely**
          - You'll bonk 30 minutes later
          - Maintain some carb intake even if reduced

          **What not to do:**

          Hammer harder while nauseous. You'll either vomit or shut down completely.

          **The rule:** Gut distress is your body telling you to back off intensity. Listen for 10 minutes, then resume pace once stomach settles.

          

          
### The Reality Check on Fueling

          Most athletes under-fuel during long events. Not because they don't know better—because it's hard.

At mile 100, eating another gel might make you gag. Your stomach might feel full. You might not feel hungry. None of that changes the math: you're burning calories faster than you're consuming them, and eventually the tank will hit empty.

          **The solution:** Treat fueling as a non-negotiable task, not an optional one based on hunger.

          Set a timer on your bike computer. Every 20 minutes: consume calories. Every 15 minutes: drink. Make it automatic. Don't wait until you feel hungry or thirsty—by then, you're already behind.

          This is why practice matters. By race day, eating and drinking on schedule should feel like shifting gears—just something you do without thinking about it.

          

          
### Weight Management vs Performance

          You want to be lean for racing. Lighter climbs easier. Lower body fat improves power-to-weight ratio.

          But chasing leanness during a training block is self-sabotage.

          The Training Block Rule
          During your 12-week build, your job is to train hard and recover well. Not cut weight.

          **Why?**

          Energy deficit impairs recovery. Under-fueled training produces inferior workouts. You're trying to build fitness, not starve yourself into a smaller body.

          **The hierarchy:**
          1. Train consistently and well
          2. Recover fully
          3. Maintain current weight or gain slightly

          If you finish your 12 weeks 2kg heavier but significantly fitter, you did it right.

          When to Cut Weight
          After your race. During the off-season. When training volume is low and intensity is moderate.

          A 500-calorie daily deficit over 8-12 weeks can drop 4-6kg without destroying your fitness. Do this between racing seasons, not during them.

          **The rule:** You can be lean or you can be fast. Pick one per season. Most of the time, pick fast.

          Body Composition Reality Check
          Optimal racing weight is highly individual. Some athletes race well at 8% body fat. Others race well at 14%.

          There is no universal "race weight."

          **What matters:** power-to-weight ratio. If your FTP is 300W at 75kg (4.0 W/kg) and you cut to 70kg but your FTP drops to 280W (also 4.0 W/kg), you gained nothing and probably lost durability.

          **The rule:** Chase performance metrics, not scale numbers. If your FTP and climbing times improve, your weight is fine. If they're declining, eat more.

          

          
### The Bottom Line

          Nutrition determines 8% of your race result. That's significant but not worth obsessing over.

          **Daily nutrition:** Match carbs to training load. Get adequate protein. Don't fear fat. Eat real food.

          **Supplements:** Vitamin D if deficient, creatine for high-intensity work, caffeine before hard sessions. Everything else is optional or snake oil.

          **During training:** Practice eating 60-80g carbs per hour on long rides. Train your gut like you train your legs.

          **Race day:** Eat a familiar pre-race meal 3-4 hours before. Start fueling at 30-45 minutes into the race. Hit 70g carbs per hour consistently. Set a timer so your stupid race brain doesn't forget.

          **When your stomach rebels:** Back off intensity for 10 minutes and switch to liquids. Don't stop eating entirely.

          **Weight management:** Happens in the off-season, not during training blocks. Chase performance, not scale numbers.

          Get the basics right. Execute consistently. That's 95% of nutrition.

        

# 9: MENTAL TRAINING

Physical training builds the engine. Mental training determines whether you use that engine when things get hard.

And in any race measured in hours, things will get hard. Your body will hurt. Your motivation will waver. You'll wonder why you signed up for this. These moments are predictable.

The techniques in this section aren't abstract psychology---they're practical tools that work during racing. They're drawn from our Gravel Grit mental training program. But like any skill, they require practice.

## 
  
    
### Mental Training Framework

    
      
        1. Foundation: Breathing & Presence
        **6-2-7 Technique:** Inhale 6 counts, hold 2, exhale 7. Calms nervous system, brings focus to present moment.

      
      
        2. Reframing: Change Your Story
        **Instead of:** This hurts → **Say:** This is my body adapting. I'm getting stronger.

        **Instead of:** I can't do this → **Say:** I'm doing it right now. One pedal stroke at a time.

      
      
        3. Anchoring: Physical Cues
        **Power position:** Hands in drops, core engaged, smooth pedal stroke. This is your race mode trigger.

        **Breathing rhythm:** Match cadence to breath (e.g., 2 pedal strokes per breath). Creates flow state.

      
      
        4. Acceptance: The Suffering Contract
        **You signed up for this.** Discomfort is part of the deal. Accept it. Don't fight it. Work with it.

        **Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.**

      
      
        5. Purpose: Remember Your Why
        **Why are you here?** Connect to your deeper motivation. This race matters because you chose it.

      
    
  

### The 6-2-7 Breathing Technique

This is a simple technique for controlling your arousal state---how activated or calm you feel. It works by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the fight-or-flight response that makes you panic or tense up.

**The pattern:** Inhale for 6 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, exhale for 7 seconds.

The key is that the exhale is longer than the inhale. This is what triggers the calming response. The exact numbers matter less than the principle: long exhale, short inhale.

### When to use it:

Pre-race anxiety. The night before or morning of the race, when your mind is racing and your heart rate is elevated despite sitting still. 3-5 cycles of 6-2-7 breathing will calm your nervous system.

Mid-race panic. When things feel out of control---you're dropped from your group, you just flatted, the pain is overwhelming. 6-2-7 breathing resets your state so you can think clearly.

After a bad section. After a crash, a mechanical, or a period of suffering where you lost time or position. 6-2-7 breathing helps you process it and move on instead of dwelling.

### How to practice:

Start with 5 minutes daily, sitting quietly. Just breathe. Count the rhythm. Feel the calming effect. Then practice during easy rides---prove to yourself you can do the breathing pattern while pedaling.

Eventually, practice during hard efforts. You should be able to do 6-2-7 breathing even when working at threshold. It's harder, but possible, and that's when you need it most.

By race day, the technique should be automatic. You shouldn't have to think about the mechanics---just trigger it when needed.

### Performance Statements

Your internal monologue affects your performance. When you catch yourself thinking "I can't do this" or "this is too hard," those thoughts become self-fulfilling prophecies. Your brain interprets them as permission to quit.

Performance statements are pre-planned phrases that replace negative self-talk with useful direction. They redirect your attention from suffering to action.

### Three types of performance statements:

**Technical cues** focus on execution rather than pain. Examples: "Smooth pedal stroke." "Relax your shoulders." "Light hands on the bars." These give your brain something productive to do instead of focusing on suffering.

**Pain responses** acknowledge difficulty without surrendering to it. Examples: "This is supposed to be hard." "If you keep pedaling, you'll get there." "Pain is temporary, quitting is permanent." These reframe suffering as expected rather than catastrophic.

**Process statements** keep you focused on the next achievable goal rather than the overwhelming total. Examples: "Just get to the next aid station." "One more climb." "Next mile marker." These break the race into manageable chunks.

### How to create your personal statements:

Write 3-5 statements now, while you're not suffering. Choose phrases that resonate with you personally. Some people respond to aggressive language ("Harden up, this is what you trained for"), others to calm language ("You're okay, just keep moving"). Pick what works for you.

Memorize them. Practice them during training rides. Test them during hard workouts. By race day, they should be immediately available when you need them.

Store them in three categories: technical (when execution is falling apart), pain (when suffering feels overwhelming), and process (when the finish feels impossibly far away).

### Personal Highlight Reel

Visualization is a well-documented performance tool. But it works best when it's personal and specific, not generic imagery of "success."

A highlight reel is a mental movie you can play to access confidence and motivation on demand. It's built from your actual experiences and your specific race goals.

### How to build your highlight reel:

**Scene 1: Past moment of strength.** Recall a specific time when you overcame something difficult, proved yourself, or succeeded against odds. Not a vague memory---a specific moment with details. Where were you? What did it feel like? Who was there? How did you feel afterward? Make this vivid.

**Scene 2: Future crucial moment in this race.** Visualize a specific section where you see yourself executing perfectly. Maybe it's climbing a specific hill with your group. Maybe it's the final 20 miles when others are fading. See yourself strong, in control, handling it well.

**Scene 3: Crossing the finish line.** In full detail. What you see, what you hear, what you feel in your body, the emotions. Make this so vivid you can almost taste it.

### How to practice visualization:

Do it in first person---through your own eyes, not watching yourself like a movie. Include as much sensory detail as possible: what you see, hear, feel in your body, smell. The more sensory channels you activate, the more powerful the visualization.

Practice until you can trigger the confident, motivated feeling on demand. That's the goal---not just seeing the images, but accessing the emotional state that comes with them.

### When to use your highlight reel:

Race morning, before getting out of bed. 5-10 minutes of visualization sets the tone for the day.

Any time during the race when you need a mental boost. It takes 30 seconds to run through your highlight reel while pedaling. Use it when motivation sags.

## Race Day Mental Checklist

Here's how to integrate these tools on race day:

**Race morning (before getting up):** Run through your highlight reel. 5-10 minutes of visualization. See yourself succeeding. Feel it.

**Race morning (after waking up):** 6-2-7 breathing if you're anxious. Three cycles minimum. Stay calm, not amped.

**Pre-start (last 30 minutes):** Review your performance statements mentally. Have them ready. Check your process goals (first aid station, first hour, first big climb---not the finish line yet).

**During the race:** Stay in process focus. Next aid station. Next climb. Next hour. The race happens in segments, not all at once.

Use performance statements when suffering increases. Have them queued up and ready.

**Crisis moments:** When things go wrong (and they will), follow this sequence:

-  Breathing: 3-5 cycles of 6-2-7

-  Statement: Your most powerful performance statement

-  Action: The smallest possible next step (just pedal 100 more meters,
> then reassess)

This sequence breaks the spiral of panic. Breathing calms your nervous system. Statement redirects your thoughts. Action gives you something concrete to do.

The bottom line on mental training: These tools work, but only if you practice them. Don't wait until mile 150 to try 6-2-7 breathing for the first time. Practice during training so they're automatic during racing.

# 10: Race Tactics for Unbound Gravel 200

Every long gravel race follows a predictable three-act structure. Understanding this structure lets you make smart decisions when others are making emotional ones.

The specifics vary by race---some races front-load the climbing, some back-load it, some are flat. But the psychological and physiological patterns are consistent across all long events.

Here's how it plays out, and what your job is in each phase.

### The Three-Act Structure

## 
  
    
      Phase
      When
      What's Happening
      Your Job
    
  
  
    
      **Act 1: The Start**
      0 - 2 hours
      High energy, adrenaline, everyone goes too hard. Groups form. Positioning matters.
      Stay calm. Don't chase. Fuel early (first 30 min). Find your rhythm. Let the race come to you.
    
    
      **Act 2: The Grind**
      2 - 10 hours
      The real race. Fatigue sets in. Groups break up. Mental game begins. This is where races are won or lost.
      Stay consistent. Fuel every 20-30 min. Manage effort (don't redline). Use mental techniques. One section at a time.
    
    
      **Act 3: The Finish**
      10 hours - Finish
      Everything hurts. Decision fatigue. Final push. This is where training pays off.
      Empty the tank. Use everything you've got. Remember your why. Push through the pain. Finish strong.
    
  

## Phase | When | What's Happening | Your Job

### Phase 1: The Madness (Miles 0-25)

The first 60-90 minutes of any gravel race is chaos. Fresh legs meet nervous energy meet a crowded course. People who trained alone all winter suddenly realize they're uncomfortable in groups. People who didn't do the work try to hang with people who did.

Attacks fly. Groups form, then shatter, then reform. The pace is erratic. Someone surges on every climb. The whole field is making decisions based on adrenaline and ego rather than strategy and fitness.

## Your job in this phase is simple: survive.

Don't try to win the race in the first hour. You can't. But you can definitely lose it. Chasing attacks you can't sustain. Riding too hard to stay with a group that's going to explode in another 20 minutes. Forgetting to eat and drink because you're focused on positioning.

Find a group moving at a pace that feels sustainable to you---not exciting, not easy, sustainable. Settle in. Eat. Drink. Let others burn matches.

The riders making huge efforts to get to the front in the first 30 minutes? Most of them will fade. Let them go. You'll see them again later, and they'll be hurting.

### Phase 2: False Dawn (Miles 25-75)

After the initial chaos settles, order returns. Groups stabilize. Pace becomes more predictable. The race can start to feel manageable, even easy.

Don't be fooled. This is the setup for phase three.

This is the phase where good execution means staying disciplined about nutrition and hydration. Your body doesn't hurt yet. You feel fine. It's tempting to skip a gel or wait longer between drinks. Don't.

This is also the phase where you contribute to your group's pace line, but you don't take hero pulls. Pull through, do your share, but don't try to impress anyone. Save that energy.

Watch for riders who are overworking---taking pulls that are too long, going to the front too often, breathing harder than they should be. They're making withdrawals they'll pay for in phase three.

You want to exit this phase feeling good but not great. Fresh but not antsy. If you're bored, that's perfect. Boredom in phase two means you're executing correctly.

### Phase 3: The Piper (Final 50-100 Miles)

This is when the bill comes due. This is the race.

Under-fueled riders bonk. Their pace craters. They go from holding 18mph to struggling to hold 12mph. You'll pass them. Don't feel bad---they made that choice in phase two when they skipped nutrition.

Under-prepared riders cramp. Their legs seize up. They're forced to slow down or stop. This is what happens when you show up without doing the training.

Mentally weak riders quit. Not literally abandon---though some do. But mentally they check out. They're just surviving, not racing anymore.

If you've done the work---the training, the nutrition practice, the mental preparation---this is where you move up. You're not attacking. You're not surging. You're just maintaining your pace while others lose theirs.

Watch for riders who are struggling:

- Pace dropping noticeably

- Dropped off groups and riding alone

- Weaving slightly (sign of bonking)

- Labored breathing out of proportion to pace

Move past them steadily. Don't attack past them---just maintain your pace and roll by. Save your energy for the riders who are still strong.

This phase is a war of attrition. The question isn't who's fastest---it's who did the best job of managing the first two phases. If that's you, this is where you collect the rewards.

****Unbound Gravel 200****-Specific Tactics

## Start conservatively. Fuel early and often. Be patient on climbs.

### Aid Station Strategy

## Use aid stations for quick refills. Don't linger.

  
### In-Race Decision Tree

  When things go sideways (and at some point they will), follow protocol instead of panic.

  Flat Tire
  

    - Stay calm - this is expected at Unbound, not a crisis

- Flip bike upside down or lean against hip

- Check if sealant is working (spin wheel, look for bubbles)

- If hole visible, insert plug immediately

- If plug fails or sidewall cut, replace tube

- Reinflate to race pressure (check your weight table)

- Spin wheel to verify no rub

- Resume at Z2 for 2-3 minutes to settle back in

  

  Dropped from Group
  

    - Don't panic - emotional response costs more energy than you have

- Assess honestly: were you overextended or did they surge?

- Find YOUR sustainable pace (probably Z2-low Z3)

- Look for riders at similar pace within 30-60 seconds

- Form new working group if possible - communicate intentions

- If solo, accept it - focus on YOUR race, not theirs

- Use solo time gaps to fuel and recover without group pressure

  

  Bonking
  

    - STOP IMMEDIATELY - don't try to push through

- Sit down if possible (don't stand around)

- Consume 2-3 gels or 200-300 calories FAST

- Wait 15-20 minutes MINIMUM

- Let sugar hit bloodstream - this takes time, be patient

- Drink 16oz water with gels

- Resume at Z1-Z2 pace ONLY

- Fuel aggressively for next hour to rebuild glycogen stores

  

  Cramping
  

    - Consume sodium (salt tabs or pretzels/chips) + 16oz water immediately

- Stretch gently - don't force it or you'll tear muscle fibers

- Drop to Z1-Z2 for 10-15 minutes minimum

- Back off intensity by 10-15% even after cramps resolve

- Continue aggressive sodium intake rest of race

- Don't resume hard efforts until cramping completely resolved

  

  
### Mental Landmarks

  Long races have predictable psychological phases. Knowing when they tend to show up makes them easier to handle.

  The Honeymoon (Miles 25-60)
  Everything feels easy. Legs are fresh. Groups rolling smooth. HUGE temptation to go hard and 'get ahead.' DON'T. This is the setup for the dark patch at mile 130. Stay disciplined now, dominate later. Patience wins Unbound.

  Where the Field Shatters (Miles 80-110)
  The rollers blow apart groups. You'll see attacks fly. People will drop. Stay disciplined. DO NOT chase efforts you can't sustain. The real race hasn't started yet. Save your matches for when they matter - miles 150+.

  The Dark Patch (Miles 120-150)
  Where motivation dies. You've been out here 7-9 hours. Everything hurts. The finish still feels impossibly far. This is EXPECTED - not a crisis, not unique to you. Use your performance statements. 6-2-7 breathing. Keep. Moving. Forward. One pedal stroke at a time.

  Second Wind (Miles 155-165)
  Often happens after CP3 aid station. Body and mind reset briefly. Energy returns like magic. Capitalize on this window - it doesn't last forever. This is your time to move up through the field.

  Late-Race Relief (Miles 170-180)
  Light at end of tunnel becomes real. Emporia is close enough to taste. Bodies hurt but minds lift. Use this energy surge wisely. This is where you collect rewards from earlier discipline. Push through - you've earned this.

  **Your job:** Recognize these moments as part of the script, not proof that you're failing. Stay on task, solve the next problem, and let the course come back to you.

The bottom line on tactics: The race isn't won in the first hour, but it can be lost there. Survive phase one. Execute phase two. Capitalize in phase three.

# 11: Race-Specific Preparation for Unbound Gravel 200

Every race has requirements that aren't optional. These are things that, if you skip them, the course itself will punish you. They're non-negotiable not because we're being strict---they're non-negotiable because physics and biology don't care about your intentions.

This section covers the specific preparation requirements for ****Unbound Gravel 200****, the weather considerations that matter, and the equipment you need to have dialed in.

  
### Flint Rock Hazard Protocol

  Kansas flint rock - sharp, angular, sidewall-eating. This is NOT your typical gravel.

  
    
      
        Sector
        Miles
        Risk Level
        Tactics
      
    
    
      **Flint Ridge**20-40HighAvoid the crown. Ride the smoother edges where limestone is compacted. One puncture here sets the tone for your entire day.

**The Gauntlet**85-95ExtremeSlow down 2-3 mph through here. Pick your line carefully and commit. One flat costs 15 minutes minimum. This is where races are lost.

**Final Flint Stretch**175-185ModerateTired hands make bad line choices. Stay focused. You've made it this far - don't get sloppy now.

    
  

  Protection Strategy:
  

    - **Line choice:** Avoid the crown where sharp rock concentrates.

    - **Body position:** Stay relaxed to reduce pinch-flat risk.

    - **Speed:** Maintain momentum over sharp sections instead of panic braking.

    - **If wet:** Mud + flint is the worst combo – consider dropping pressure slightly.

  

### Non-Negotiables

These aren't suggestions. They're requirements discovered through painful experience---either yours during training, or others' during previous editions of this race.

  
    
      Requirement
      By When
      Why It Matters
    
  
  
    
      **Heat adaptation protocol built into weeks 6-10

**
      Week 6
      Heat adaptation takes 2-3 weeks. Starting too late means racing unprepared in dangerous conditions.

    
    
      **Flint-specific cornering and line selection skills

**
      Week 6-8
      Technical skills prevent crashes and save energy. Poor handling wastes watts and increases risk.

    
    
      **9-hour dress rehearsal in week 9

**
      Week 9
      This tests nutrition, pacing, and mental preparation. Skipping it means discovering problems on race day.

    
    
      **Consistent training

**
      Ongoing
      Consistency is the foundation of adaptation - skip weeks, lose gains

    
    
      **Follow the plan

**
      Ongoing
      The plan works if you work it - modifications undermine the system

  **Note:** These are starting points. Adjust based on tire casing, rim width, and your own feel. When in doubt, err slightly lower for comfort and grip, not vanity PSI.

  
### Wind Protocol

  **Prevailing Pattern:** Southwest afternoon headwinds

  When It Matters:
  After 1pm, miles 100-180. This is the crux of Unbound - where the race really begins.

  Group Tactics:
  Don't pull early. Save bullets for the last 50 miles. Rotate efficiently but let stronger riders do the heavy lifting early. You'll need every match later.

  Solo Tactics:
  Accept the grind. Lower your power target by 5-10%. Stay aero. Don't fight it - you'll lose. Pace yourself for 3-4 hours of sustained headwind. Mental game matters here.

  
    Reality Check
    The wind will be harder than you expect. Lower your power targets 5–10% into sustained headwinds and protect your head. Ego burns more matches than the course.

  

These aren't suggestions. They're requirements discovered through painful experience---either yours during training, or others' during previous editions of this race.

Skip them at your own risk. The course won't care. It will simply expose the gap in your preparation.

### Weather Strategy

**Typical Conditions:** Hot and humid, 85-95°F. Heat management is critical. Start hydrated. Pre-cool if possible (cold water, ice). Wear light, breathable layers. Sun protection is mandatory (sunscreen, hat, sunglasses). Monitor forecast daily starting 5 days out. If extreme heat is forecast, adjust pacing strategy---start slower, fuel more aggressively. Check forecast again 24 hours before race and adjust gear accordingly. Wind can be a major factor---plan for crosswinds and headwinds. 

  
### Expected Time Drift

  **Unbound typically runs 1-2 hours longer than best-case estimates. Plan accordingly.

## 12 · Race Week Protocol

          By race week, the training is done. You can't add fitness in the final seven days—you can only preserve what you've built or add dumb fatigue through poor decisions.

          The goal now is simple: arrive at the start line fresh, healthy, rested, and ready. Everything you do this week serves that goal.

          
### Race Morning Timeline

          **3-4 hours before start:** Wake up. Eat a familiar, high-carb, low-fiber breakfast. This is not the time for experimentation. Eat something you've eaten before many long rides. Target 1-2g carbs per kg body weight.

          **2 hours before start:** Arrive at venue. Set up bike and gear. Use the bathroom (you'll probably go multiple times—normal). Begin sipping fluids.

          **1 hour before start:** Final bike check: tire pressure, brakes working, shifting smooth. Short warm-up spin if space and time allow—10 minutes easy, couple 30-second efforts. Start pre-race nutrition (100-200 calories of carbs).

          **30 minutes before start:** Run through your highlight reel visualization. Review your performance statements mentally. Begin settling your mind. Focus on what you can control.

          **10 minutes before start:** 6-2-7 breathing. Three cycles minimum. Find your spot in the start corral. Check that everything you need is accessible (nutrition in right pockets, bottles full and secure).

          **Start:** Controlled effort. Resist the urge to go with the first surge. Find your sustainable rhythm. Eat and drink early—first gel at 20 minutes, not 60 minutes.

          The bottom line on race week: Less is more. You've done the work. Now let your body absorb it. Show up fresh, not fatigued from last-minute training.

# 13: Masters-Specific Considerations

If you're 40-50+ training for gravel racing, your physiology has changed in ways that demand training modifications—but these changes don't mandate decline. **VO2max drops approximately 5% per decade in trained athletes versus 10% in sedentary individuals**, and this difference is almost entirely explained by training choices. The evidence is clear: masters athletes who maintain high-intensity training, prioritize recovery, and incorporate strength work can preserve 50% more aerobic capacity than their peers who train "safer."

## The Physiology Is Real, But Trainable

The decline curve looks daunting on paper but reveals opportunities on closer inspection. Maximum heart rate drops roughly **1 beat per minute per year**—this is unavoidable and affects everyone equally regardless of fitness. However, stroke volume, mitochondrial density, and lactate threshold remain highly trainable into your 60s and beyond. Research shows that **54% of VO2max variance in aging athletes** correlates with changes in training volume, not chronological age.

Three mechanisms drive longer recovery times in masters athletes. First, "inflammaging"—persistent low-grade inflammation marked by elevated CRP and IL-6—impairs muscle repair. Second, declining anabolic hormones (testosterone falls roughly 1.6% annually after 30) reduce protein synthesis efficiency. Third, older muscles require **40% more protein** to achieve the same muscle-building response as younger tissue. This isn't weakness; it's biology requiring a tactical response.

Type II fast-twitch fibers decline disproportionately with age, and these fibers are exactly what produce power for sprints, climbs, and race surges. Endurance-trained masters athletes show roughly **39% Type II fiber composition** compared to 51% in young controls—unless they strength train. Life-long strength-trained athletes maintain fiber distributions nearly identical to young individuals at approximately 52%.

## The Polarized Model Wins for Masters Athletes

Stephen Seiler's research on masters cyclists training approximately 6 hours weekly found that **4×8-minute intervals at 90% HRmax** produced significantly greater gains in threshold power, VO2max power, and aerobic capacity than either shorter (4×4 min) or longer (4×16 min) intervals. This sweet spot accumulates meaningful time at high intensity while allowing complete recovery between efforts.

The optimal intensity distribution for masters follows the 80/20 polarized model: **75-80% of training at low intensity** (below 2 mmol/L blood lactate, conversational pace), **15-20% at high intensity** (above 90% max heart rate), and less than 5% in the "black hole" of moderate intensity. Seiler observed that "threshold trainers" in his studies showed lactate profiles indicating chronic fatigue—they were "already at 2.5 mmol lactate just clipping into the pedals." Polarized masters athletes displayed profiles similar to elites at much higher absolute workloads.

This distribution works because it respects the fundamental asymmetry of stress and adaptation. Easy sessions should be genuinely easy—Zone 1, able to hold a conversation indefinitely—allowing the body to absorb prior training stress. Hard sessions should be genuinely hard, creating the stimulus for adaptation. The middle ground creates fatigue without commensurate benefit, which Seiler describes as "too much pain for too little gain."

## Recovery Becomes the Primary Training Variable

Recovery for masters athletes isn't passive time between workouts; it's an active training component requiring equal strategic attention. **Muscle recovery can take up to 72 hours longer in athletes over 50** compared to younger counterparts. This extended timeline means the workout-recovery-adaptation cycle that younger athletes can complete in 48 hours may require 72-96 hours for masters.

### Sleep

Sleep emerges as the highest-leverage recovery intervention. Research shows elite athletes need **8.3 hours to feel rested but typically achieve only 6.7 hours**, with performance decrements appearing below 7 hours. Growth hormone and testosterone—critical for tissue repair—are released primarily during deep sleep, making sleep quality as important as duration. Practical strategies include maintaining consistent sleep-wake times, avoiding high-intensity training within 4 hours of bedtime, and keeping the bedroom at 65-68°F.

### Protein Requirements

Protein requirements increase substantially for masters athletes. Target **1.6-1.8 g/kg body weight daily** for maintenance, rising to 2.0-2.4 g/kg during high training loads or when building muscle. A 75kg cyclist needs approximately 135g protein daily, distributed across 4-5 meals with 30-40g per feeding. Post-exercise protein becomes time-sensitive due to reduced absorption efficiency—consume protein within the first hour after training.

### HRV Monitoring

HRV monitoring provides objective recovery data that subjective feel can miss. Measure first thing in the morning using a validated device (Oura, Whoop, Garmin, or chest-strap apps like HRV4Training), committing to daily measurements for at least two months to establish your personal baseline. High HRV with normal resting heart rate indicates readiness for intensity. Low HRV with elevated resting heart rate signals accumulating fatigue requiring reduced load. Trends over 7-14 days matter more than single readings, and HRV should complement—not replace—subjective feel.

## Periodization Must Compress and Adapt

Traditional 4-week mesocycles with 3 weeks of building followed by 1 recovery week suit athletes in their 30s but typically overtax masters athletes. Research and coaching experience suggest **2-2.5 week builds followed by 5-7 days recovery** for athletes over 50. Joe Friel advocates a "9-day week" for older athletes, with training days extended to accommodate 2 days of recovery after hard sessions.

The year-round structure also shifts. Contrary to traditional periodization with complete base phases, masters athletes benefit from **maintaining some high-intensity training year-round** to combat age-related VO2max and power losses. Don't abandon Zone 3 work entirely even during foundation periods—a single weekly intensity session preserves neuromuscular adaptations that are expensive to rebuild.

Weekly structure for masters training 8-12 hours follows a predictable pattern: two high-intensity sessions separated by 48-72 hours, strength training scheduled immediately after key aerobic workouts (not on separate days), and the remaining volume at genuine Zone 1 effort. If training time drops to 4 days, collapse to 3 days and extend one session rather than compressing all sessions into short, intense efforts.

Progressive overload must emphasize accumulation over escalation. Rather than pushing harder each workout, add intervals while maintaining intensity. Seiler notes that "top endurance athletes aren't hitting every interval workout aiming for higher power—they progress by doing more intervals, accumulating more time at high workloads." A threshold progression might advance from 6×5 minutes in week one, to 3×8 minutes in week two, to 3×10 minutes in week three, with identical power targets throughout.

## Strength Training Is Mandatory, Not Optional

The research is unambiguous: **strength training reduces overuse injury risk by 33%** while improving cycling economy, preserving bone density (critical since cycling is non-weight-bearing), and countering sarcopenia. Cycling alone cannot prevent muscle loss—the movement pattern lacks sufficient loading to maintain Type II fibers. One study showed adding strength training produced **9-13% improvements in Wingate peak power** in masters cyclists.

Focus on heavy compound movements: squats (goblet or back), deadlifts, lunges, and step-ups for lower body; rows and pressing for upper body. Train at approximately **80% of 1-rep maximum for 4-5 reps**, accumulating 16-30 total reps across lower-body exercises per session. Training to failure adds fatigue without additional benefit for endurance athletes—stop 1-2 reps short.

Schedule strength training immediately following key aerobic workouts rather than on separate days. This consolidates stress into fewer recovery periods. During the racing season, maintain one strength session weekly; during the off-season, complete 2-3 sessions. The goal isn't bodybuilding—it's preserving the neuromuscular qualities that endurance training alone cannot maintain.

## When to Skip Workouts Versus Push Through

The decision framework requires combining objective and subjective data. **Skip or significantly modify the workout** when resting heart rate is elevated more than 10% above normal, HRV shows multi-day suppression, sleep has been poor for 2+ consecutive nights, muscle soreness persists beyond 48 hours, or motivation has been absent for several consecutive days. These signs indicate incomplete recovery where additional stress delays—rather than drives—adaptation.

**Push through (modified intensity)** when general fatigue is present but objective metrics remain normal, when feeling physically recovered but not mentally eager, or when slight tiredness improves during warm-up. In these cases, begin the session at reduced intensity and reassess 15 minutes in. If performance normalizes, complete the planned session. If it doesn't, transition to easy endurance work.

Warning signs of overtraining syndrome require immediate attention: performance decline lasting more than 4 weeks, elevated perceived exertion at normal workloads, disturbed sleep despite fatigue, increased illness frequency, hoarse voice after workouts, and mood disturbances. Recovery from true overtraining syndrome can require months to years—catching functional overreaching early prevents this cascade.

## Race-Day Execution Differs from Younger Athletes

Warm-ups become more critical and should be longer. Target **20-40 minutes** for short events (criteriums, cyclocross, time trials under an hour), beginning with 5-10 minutes of off-bike dynamic mobility (leg swings, hip circles, arm rotations), followed by progressive on-bike effort culminating in 2-3 short high-intensity "opener" efforts 5-10 minutes before the start. This activates the aerobic energy system, increases hemoglobin oxygen-release efficiency, and triggers post-activation potentiation for improved muscle force production.

Pacing strategy should favor negative splits more strongly than for younger athletes. Starting conservatively prevents early glycogen depletion that becomes increasingly difficult to recover from as the race progresses. For events lasting 3+ hours, target 60-65% of FTP and accept that heart rate will drift downward throughout—this is normal fatigue response. Use power meters rather than heart rate or perceived exertion for pacing precision.

Heat tolerance declines with age through reduced sweat output per gland, delayed sweating onset, and decreased skin blood flow. However, research shows that **fitness is protective**: sweating rate correlates more strongly with VO2max than chronological age. Maintain aggressive hydration (16-20+ oz per hour), add electrolytes when exceeding 20 oz hourly, start races early to avoid peak heat, and use pre-cooling strategies (cold drinks, ice vests) before hot events.

## The Mindset Shift That Matters Most

Joe Friel's central thesis in "Fast After 50" challenges the conventional wisdom that older athletes should "take it easy." The research supports the opposite: **high-intensity training may slow age-related VO2max decline by up to 50%**, triggers essential hormonal responses, and maintains the fast-twitch fibers that aging otherwise preferentially degrades. Solely engaging in long slow distance neither improves oxygen consumption capacity nor postpones lactate accumulation.

The correct mindset isn't training harder—it's training with greater precision. Recovery windows expand, so each training stimulus must count. The cost of missed workouts increases because rebuild rates slow, so consistency matters more than occasional heroic efforts. Injury consequences multiply because healing takes longer, so prevention through strength work and adequate recovery becomes non-negotiable.

Seiler frames this as competitive advantage: "Your age isn't merely a number—it's a competitive advantage. You have the wisdom to train intelligently and the experience to execute with precision." Masters athletes have decades of training adaptation that younger athletes haven't accumulated. The peripheral muscle capacity—the ability of trained muscles to extract and utilize oxygen—holds steady with maintained training even as central cardiac capacity declines.

## The Bottom Line

Masters cycling performance depends less on fighting biology and more on optimizing around it. The **5% per decade VO2max decline** in trained athletes—half the sedentary rate—demonstrates that training choices drive outcomes more than birthdays. Polarized intensity distribution (80/20), compressed recovery cycles (2-3 weeks), mandatory strength training (2x weekly), and precision recovery monitoring (HRV, sleep, protein) form an integrated system rather than isolated tactics.

The central insight from both Seiler's research and Friel's coaching philosophy is that masters athletes can maintain high performance not by training less, but by training more deliberately. Hard days must be genuinely hard to trigger adaptation; easy days must be genuinely easy to enable recovery; and the middle ground must be avoided as metabolically expensive without commensurate benefit. This framework respects physiological reality while refusing age-related defeatism—exactly the balance that produces results in the 40-50+ athlete.

        
          
## 14 · Women-Specific Considerations

          **Women aren't small men.**

          This isn't patronizing bullshit. It's biology. Your physiology differs from men's in ways that affect training, recovery, fueling, and performance. Ignoring these differences makes training harder than it needs to be.

          
### Menstrual Cycle and Training

          Your cycle affects training capacity. Not as an excuse—as a reality to work with.

          **Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):** Estrogen rises. This is when you can handle more intensity. Schedule hard workouts, threshold sessions, and VO2max work during this phase. Your body is primed for adaptation.

          **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):** Progesterone rises. Core temperature increases. Recovery takes longer. This is when to prioritize endurance work, recovery rides, and base building. High-intensity work feels harder and recovery is slower—that's normal, not failure.

          **Menstruation (Days 1-5):** Some women feel fine. Others experience fatigue, cramping, or mood changes. Listen to your body. If you feel terrible, take an extra rest day. If you feel good, train normally. Don't force intensity when your body says no.

          **The Bottom Line:** Track your cycle. Plan intensity during follicular phase. Plan recovery and base work during luteal phase. This isn't about limitations—it's about working with your physiology instead of against it.

          
### Iron: The Critical Difference

          Women lose iron monthly through menstruation. This is the single biggest physiological difference that affects performance.

          **Ferritin Targets:** Aim for ferritin >50 ng/mL for optimal performance. "Normal" lab ranges (15-150 ng/mL) are too broad. Many women sit at 15-30 ng/mL and feel fine in daily life, but performance suffers. You need higher levels to support training adaptation.

          **Get Tested:** Check ferritin, serum iron, and TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) before starting this plan. If ferritin is 

        
          
## 15 · Frequently Asked Questions

          
### Q: What if I miss a week of training?

          **A:** One week won't kill you. Jump back in where the plan currently is—don't try to "make up" missed work. Forward progress only. If you missed two+ weeks due to illness or injury, reassess whether your race timeline is realistic.

          

          
### Q: Can I do this plan entirely on Zwift/TrainerRoad/indoors?

          **A:** Technically yes, but you're missing critical skills development. Indoor training builds fitness, but outdoor riding builds handling, pacing, and mental resilience. Do at least 30-40% of your volume outside, especially long rides.

          

          
### Q: What if my FTP changes mid-plan?

          **A:** Test again at Week 6-7 if you're curious, but only adjust zones if FTP changed by 5+ watts. Small fluctuations are noise. Major changes (10+ watts) mean you need to recalculate zones and adjust your workout targets accordingly.

          

          
### Q: How do I know if I'm overtraining?

          **A:** Elevated resting heart rate, persistent fatigue, declining performance, irritability, poor sleep, loss of motivation. If you're hitting 3+ of these symptoms, take 2-3 days completely off, then return at reduced volume. Recovery makes you fast.

          

          
### Q: What if I can't hit the prescribed watts?

          **A:** Either your FTP is set too high, or you're under-recovered. Take an extra rest day, retest FTP if needed. Don't grind through workouts at the wrong intensity—that's junk miles that compromise adaptation.

          

          
### Q: Should I follow the plan exactly or can I move workouts around?

          **A:** Follow the plan as written. The order isn't random—it assumes a typical M-F work schedule with weekends for long rides. Hard days are spaced for optimal recovery. If you work nights or have a non-standard schedule, shift the entire week forward/backward as needed, but don't rearrange individual workouts.

          

          
### Q: How much weight will I lose during this plan?

          **A:** Your mileage may vary. Know this: losing weight and fueling performance are often in conflict. Any meaningful, long-lasting attempt to lose weight should be undertaken in the off-season, NOT during build-up to an eating contest on a bike (which is what a gravel race is). Fuel your training properly or accept compromised results.

          

          
### Q: Can I do other sports while following this plan?

          **A:** Light activity (yoga, walking, easy swimming) is fine. Running, CrossFit, or other high-intensity sports will compromise your cycling training. Pick one goal. You can't serve two masters and expect peak performance from either.

          

          
### Q: What if I get sick during training?

          **A:** Above the neck (head cold): reduce intensity by one zone, monitor closely. Below the neck (chest, stomach): skip the workout entirely. Don't be a hero—training while sick extends recovery time and risks turning a minor illness into something serious.

          

          
### Q: How do I taper if my race date changes?

          **A:** If race moves earlier: condense taper to 1 week, keep intensity but cut volume by 40%. If race moves later: add 1-2 weeks of maintenance (same intensity, 60-70% volume), then taper normally. Don't panic and overtrain.

          

          
### Q: Is this plan suitable for [other race] instead of Unbound Gravel 200?

          **A:** Maybe. If the race is similar duration (8-15 hours) and demands (sustained gravel endurance), yes. If it's significantly different (shorter, hillier, more technical), you'll need modifications. The fitness transfers, but race-specific skills don't.

          

          
### Q: What if I don't have access to gravel roads for training?

          **A:** Use what you have. Road riding builds fitness. Fitness translates to gravel. You'll need at least a few gravel rides (weeks 6-10) to dial in handling and equipment, but the bulk of fitness work can be done on pavement. Don't use lack of gravel as an excuse to skip training.

          

          
### Q: Should I train with a group or solo?

          **A:** Both. Solo for structured intervals (better execution, no distractions). Group for long rides (mental training, pacing practice, working with others). Mix it up based on the workout goal. Don't let your training partners dictate your training stress.

          

          
### Q: What's the minimum equipment I need to start this plan today?

          **A:** A bike that fits and works. Power meter (required for this plan). Heart rate chest strap (required for backup). That's it. Everything else—fancy computers, carbon wheels, aero bars—can be figured out over 12 weeks. Stop shopping and start training.
