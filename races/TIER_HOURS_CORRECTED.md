# Tier Hours - CORRECTED

## Old Plans (Source of Truth)

From template.json files:
- **Ayahuasca**: 0-5 hrs/week
- **Finisher**: 8-10 hrs/week
- **Compete**: 12-15 hrs/week
- **Podium**: 20-25 hrs/week

## What Was Wrong

**Before (Incorrect):**
- Time Crunched: 0-5 hrs/week ✅
- Finisher: 5-8 hrs/week ❌ (should be 8-10)
- Compete: 8-12 hrs/week ❌ (should be 12-15)
- Compete Masters: 8-12 hrs/week ❌ (should be 12-15)
- Podium: 12+ hrs/week ❌ (should be 20-25)

**After (Corrected):**
- Time Crunched: 0-5 hrs/week ✅
- Finisher: 8-10 hrs/week ✅
- Compete: 12-15 hrs/week ✅
- Compete Masters: 12-15 hrs/week ✅
- Podium: 20-25 hrs/week ✅

## Progression Now Makes Sense

- **Time Crunched** (0-5): Minimal time, HIIT-focused
- **Finisher** (8-10): Traditional base building
- **Compete** (12-15): Polarized training for competitive
- **Podium** (20-25): Elite-level high volume

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `generate_expanded_race_plans.py` - PLAN_TYPES dictionary
2. ✅ `guide_generator.py` - get_weekly_hours() function
