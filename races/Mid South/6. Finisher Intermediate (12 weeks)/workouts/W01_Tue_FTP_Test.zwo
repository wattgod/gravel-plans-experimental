  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test + Easy Spin</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 20min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 5min @ 120% FTP
• 20min @ 105% FTP

COOL-DOWN:
• 15min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Assessment and baseline. Accurate testing sets accurate training zones. Today's numbers guide tomorrow's training.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 70-minute rides, aim for 1 position change.</description>
