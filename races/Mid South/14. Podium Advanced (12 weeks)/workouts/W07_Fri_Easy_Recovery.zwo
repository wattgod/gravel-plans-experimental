  <name>W07 Fri - Easy Endurance Volume + Tempo</name>
  <description>MAIN SET:
Unstructured session
• Position: Alternating
• Cadence: self-selected (comfortable endurance cadence)

PURPOSE:
Aerobic base building. Easy riding builds mitochondrial density and fat oxidation—the foundation everything else rests on.

• WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. Prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
