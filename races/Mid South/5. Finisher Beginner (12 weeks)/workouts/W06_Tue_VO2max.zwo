  <name>W06 Tue - VO2max Intervals</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 20min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 6x4min @ 112% FTP (4min recovery)
• 0min @ 110% FTP
• 0min @ 110% FTP
• 0min @ 110% FTP
• Cadence: 90-100rpm (high turnover for VO2max efficiency)
• Position: Seated, hoods

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
VO2max development. Maximum aerobic power—the engine that drives race-winning attacks and sustained high-intensity efforts.

Level 3: Cadence and position focus. Same structure—now refine the execution.

• WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. Prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
