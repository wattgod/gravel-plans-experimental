  <name>W11 Tue - Taper Intensity</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 30min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 3x4min @ 109% FTP (5min recovery)
• 2x8min @ 99% FTP (5min recovery)
• Cadence: 85-95rpm (comfortable training cadence)
• Position: Seated, hoods

COOL-DOWN:
• 15min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Quality training. Building race-specific fitness through structured work.

Level 6: Peak volume. Maximum training load. You're building the capacity race day demands.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• ROBUST TAPER:
Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume is low, but maintain sharpness. For competitive athletes, freshness is everything for a 100-mile day.</description>
