  <name>W05 Sat - Final Long Race Prep</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 10min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 110min @ 68% FTP
• 20min @ 95% FTP
• 20min @ 98% FTP
• 20min @ 100% FTP
• 20min @ 103% FTP
• 90min @ 68% FTP
• Cadence: 85-95rpm (comfortable training cadence)
• Position: Seated, hoods

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Quality training. Building race-specific fitness through structured work.

Level 3: Cadence and position focus. Same structure—now refine the execution.

• WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. Prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• HYDRATION:
&gt;90 min high intensity/intervals/heat: 90g carbs/hr. 1.5 bottles/hr minimum. 1000-1500 mg sodium/hr. Aggressive cooling: ice sock, dump water, shade stops when practical. Replace ~75% of losses within 2 hours post-ride.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• AGGRESSIVE FUELING:
Target 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on dress rehearsal). Train your gut aggressively. This is critical for long race days. Competitors need aggressive fueling—race day isn't the time to discover your stomach can't handle 80g carbs/hour. Practice your race-day nutrition products. Start fueling from mile 1.

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 324-minute rides, aim for 5 position changes.</description>
