  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test (if HRV green)</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 15min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 3min @ 85% FTP
• 20min @ 100% FTP

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Assessment and baseline. Accurate testing sets accurate training zones. Today's numbers guide tomorrow's training.


HRV Check: Green? Do test. Yellow? Ride 45 min easy, try tomorrow. Red? Skip, test next week. Masters FTP testing: sustained 20-min at "hard but controlled" pace. Multiply avg power × 0.93 (conservative for 50+). This sets zones for polarized training: Z1-Z2 = 55-75% FTP (easy), Z4-Z5+ = 95%+ FTP (hard). Write everything down.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
