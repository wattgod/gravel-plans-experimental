  <name>W07 Tue - Combined G-Spot + Threshold</name>
  <description>WARM-UP:
• 15min building from Z1 to Z2

MAIN SET:
• 2x15min @ 89% FTP (5min recovery)
• 2x10min @ 98% FTP (6min recovery)
• Cadence: 85-95rpm (sustainable sweet spot cadence)
• Position: Seated, hoods

COOL-DOWN:
• 10min easy spin Z1-Z2

PURPOSE:
Sweet spot work. Maximum aerobic stimulus for minimum recovery cost. The most efficient zone for building race fitness.

Level 4: Consolidation. Let the body absorb the previous weeks' work. Quality over ambition.

• WEATHER ADAPTATION (Weeks 4-10):
Complete this quality session in normal conditions (preserve workout quality). Weather adaptation happens on endurance rides. Prepare for unpredictable conditions—cold, heat, wind, or mud. Practice your race-day clothing and nutrition strategies during long rides.

• HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
