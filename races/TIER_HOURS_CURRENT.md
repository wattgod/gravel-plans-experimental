# Current Tier Hours Configuration

## Current Values

### In `generate_expanded_race_plans.py`:
- **Time Crunched**: 0-5 hrs/week
- **Finisher**: 5-8 hrs/week
- **Compete**: 8-12 hrs/week
- **Compete Masters**: 8-12 hrs/week
- **Podium**: 12+ hrs/week

### In `guide_generator.py`:
- **TIME CRUNCHED**: 0-5
- **FINISHER**: 5-8
- **COMPETE**: 8-12
- **PODIUM**: 12+

## Issues

1. **Compete Masters** has same hours as Compete (8-12) - should it be different?
2. **Gap between Finisher and Compete** - is 5-8 → 8-12 correct?
3. **Podium** at 12+ - is this the right threshold?

## Questions

What should the correct hours be for each tier?
