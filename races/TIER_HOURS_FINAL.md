# Tier Hours - FINAL

## Final Configuration

- **Time Crunched**: 0-5 hrs/week
- **Finisher**: 8-10 hrs/week
- **Compete**: 12-17 hrs/week
- **Compete Masters**: 12-17 hrs/week
- **Podium**: 18-25 hrs/week

## Rationale

- **Compete** (12-17): Wider range accommodates varying competitive athletes
- **Podium** (18-25): Starts at 18 (not 20) to allow more athletes into elite tier, extends to 25 for true professional volume

## Progression

- **Time Crunched** (0-5): Minimal time, HIIT-focused
- **Finisher** (8-10): Traditional base building
- **Compete** (12-17): Polarized training for competitive performance
- **Podium** (18-25): Elite-level high volume
