## 1. TRAINING METHOD USED

### **Polarized Training Model**

All 5 plans follow a **polarized training approach**:

- **80% Low-Intensity Endurance (Z1-Z2)**
  - Builds aerobic base and fat oxidation
  - Develops durability for 12-16 hour efforts
  - Active recovery between hard sessions

- **20% High-Intensity Intervals**
  - VO2max intervals (30/30s, extended VO2)
  - Threshold work (steady state, progressive)
  - Mixed intervals (climbing simulations)
  - Race-specific efforts

### Plan-Specific Philosophies:

1. **Finisher (0-5 hrs/week)**: HIIT-focused survival mode
2. **Finisher Plus (5-8 hrs/week)**: Balanced HIIT + endurance
3. **Compete (8-12 hrs/week)**: Structured periodization
4. **Compete Masters (8-12 hrs/week)**: Masters-optimized recovery
5. **Podium (12+ hrs/week)**: High-volume, race-specific preparation
