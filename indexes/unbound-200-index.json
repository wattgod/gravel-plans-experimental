They plan for it, obsess over heat protocols, and show up knowing that crossing the line in Emporia means something. The course itself isn't revolutionary—rolling terrain, gravel, heat. What makes it legendary is the field, the atmosphere, and the weight of the finish line. If you finish Unbound, you've earned it."
