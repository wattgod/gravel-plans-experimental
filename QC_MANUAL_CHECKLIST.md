# QC LEVEL 3: MANUAL SPOT CHECK
# ================================

## Goal
Verify that guide-specific variations:
1. Actually appear in the right places
2. Flow naturally with surrounding content
3. Strengthen positioning (not just add jargon)
4. Make sense together (no contradictions)

## How to Do It

### Step 1: Pick 3 Descriptions (Representative Sample)

Pick one from each volume tier:
- Low volume: ayahuasca_beginner.html
- Mid volume: finisher_intermediate.html
- High volume: compete_advanced.html OR podium_elite.html

### Step 2: Read Each Description Completely

Don't just grep for terms. Read the whole thing as a potential customer would.

### Step 3: Check These 5 Things

#### ✓ Check 1: OPENING (Solution State)
**Question:** Does it reference guide-specific content?

**Good examples:**
- "G Spot training (88-92% FTP)"
- "GOAT Method training"
- "Three-Act pacing structure"

**Bad examples:**
- Generic "structured training" with no specifics
- Still saying "I built this for..." (should be removed)

**Status:** PASS / FAIL / NOTES:

---

#### ✓ Check 2: STORY (Coach Justification)
**Question:** Does it explain WHY the guide-specific content matters?

**Good examples:**
- "Most plans use Sweet Spot. This uses G Spot (88-92%)—sustainable for 10+ hours"
- "Generic plans ignore mental training. This practices 6-2-7 breathing weekly"
- "GOAT Method: G Spot progression, HRV recovery, Three-Act framework"

**Bad examples:**
- No mention of guide-specific protocols
- Vague coach-speak without specifics

**Status:** PASS / FAIL / NOTES:

---

#### ✓ Check 3: CHOICE FEATURES
**Question:** Do 2-3 features reference guide-specific content?

**Look for:**
- G Spot training (88-92% FTP)
- Three-Act pacing structure
- 6-2-7 breathing technique
- HRV monitoring protocols
- Dress rehearsal ride (7-hour simulation)
- Technical skills practice drills

**Count found:** ___/3

**Status:** PASS (2+) / FAIL (<2) / NOTES:

---

#### ✓ Check 4: GUIDE TOPICS
**Question:** Do 2-3 topics reference guide-specific content?

**Look for:**
- Race Tactics: Three-Act Structure
- Mental Skills: 6-2-7 Breathing
- G Spot Training (88-92% FTP)
- HRV-Guided Recovery

**Count found:** ___/3

**Status:** PASS (2+) / FAIL (<2) / NOTES:

---

#### ✓ Check 5: VALUE PROP BOX
**Question:** Does philosophy or props reference guide-specific content?

**Look for:**
- GOAT Method training
- G Spot progression
- Three-Act framework
- HRV-guided recovery
- 6-2-7 breathing
- Technical drills

**Count found:** ___/4

**Status:** PASS (2+) / FAIL (<2) / NOTES:

---

### Step 4: Flow Check

Read the entire description aloud. Does it:
- Flow naturally?
- Make coherent argument?
- Avoid repetition?
- Sound like "Matti voice"?
- Strengthen positioning vs generic plans?

**Overall flow:** GOOD / NEEDS WORK / NOTES:

---

### Step 5: Positioning Strength

Compare to generic competitor (e.g., TrainerRoad gravel plan).

**Does this description clearly differentiate on:**
- ✓ Specific protocols (60-80g carbs, Three-Act, heat adaptation)
- ✓ Practice-focused (not just theory)
- ✓ Race-specific preparation
- ✓ Tested/practiced (not just explained)

**Positioning strength:** STRONG / WEAK / NOTES:

---

## Step 6: TIER-SPECIFIC POSITIONING (CRITICAL)

### ✓ Check 1: Opening Addresses Tier's Core Concern

**Ayahuasca (0-5 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: Limited time but doing it anyway
- Should address: Time constraints, efficient training
- Beat/contrast: Most think you need 15 hours, you have 4

**Finisher (8-12 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: Wants predictable results, not random fitness
- Should address: Structure, consistency, removing guesswork
- Beat/contrast: Most train randomly, this creates predictability

**Compete (12-18 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: Serious but hitting ceiling
- Should address: Breaking through plateaus, precision at volume
- Beat/contrast: Volume alone doesn't unlock next level

**Podium (18+ hrs/week):**
- Core concern: Details separate competition from podium
- Should address: Execution precision, marginal gains
- Beat/contrast: Pack fitness vs podium fitness

**Does opening address this tier's specific concern:** YES / NO / NOTES:

### ✓ Check 2: Beat/Contrast Psychology Present

**Structure should be:**
- Beat: State common/wrong approach
- Contrast: Show how this plan differs
- Payoff: Explain benefit

**Example found:** _____________________________________

**Includes slight wink/droll observation:** YES / NO

### ✓ Check 3: Full Plan Designation in Body Copy

**Requirement:** Tier AND level must appear TOGETHER at least ONCE in body

**NOT sufficient (too generic):**
- ❌ "At 8-12 hours per week..." (just hours)
- ❌ "Finisher tier athletes..." (no level)
- ❌ "This plan works for beginners..." (no tier)

**Required (full designation):**
- ✅ "The **Finisher Beginner** plan..."
- ✅ "As a **Compete Advanced** athlete..."
- ✅ "This **Ayahuasca Beginner** program..."
- ✅ "Built for **Finisher Intermediate Masters**..."

**Why this matters:**
- Self-identification: Reader sees THEIR SPECIFIC PLAN
- Not just "a finisher plan" but "THE beginner one"
- Creates precise targeting and positioning

**Full plan designation found in body:** YES / NO / WHERE: _____________________

### ✓ Check 4: Features Support Tier's Core Concern

**Do the 2-3 features listed align with this tier's problem?**

Ayahuasca → Time efficiency, simplicity
Finisher → Predictability, structure, consistency
Compete → Precision, progressive overload, systems
Podium → Execution precision, marginal gains

**Features align with tier concern:** YES / NO / NOTES:

### ✓ Check 5: Race-Specific (Not Generic)

**Checks:**
- Could this copy work for ANY gravel race? (BAD)
- Does it reference specific race demands? (GOOD)
- Race name appears 2-3 times? (GOOD)

**Examples:** Unbound = heat, distance; Mid South = mud, weather

**Race-specific positioning:** YES / NO / NOTES:

### ✓ Check 6: Tone - Slight Wink, Not Generic Coach-Speak

**Forbidden phrases (generic coach-speak):**
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Train smarter not harder"
- "Take your training to the next level"
- "Are you ready to..."
- "Transform your..."

**Any forbidden phrases found:** YES / NO / WHICH: _____________________

**Tone maintains Matti voice (direct, reality-grounded):** YES / NO

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

❌ **Too much jargon** - "G Spot" and "GOAT Method" and "Three-Act" all in opening
❌ **Contradictions** - Says "polarized training" then describes pyramidal
❌ **Generic + specific mixed** - "Structured zones" next to "88-92% FTP"
❌ **Over 3,900 chars** - Trim needed
❌ **"I built" language** - Should be removed
❌ **Repetition** - Same term used 3+ times

---

## If All 3 Pass: Ship All 15

If 3 representative samples are strong, the system is working.

## If Any Fail: Fix and Re-audit

Identify the issue:
- Variations not being selected? (Check generator)
- Wrong context? (Check variation pool placement)
- Too dense? (Trim or simplify)
- Doesn't flow? (Rewrite specific variation)

Fix, regenerate, re-check.

## Time Estimate

- 5 min per description read
- 15 min total for 3 descriptions
- 5 min for fix decisions if needed

**Total: 20 minutes for manual QC**
