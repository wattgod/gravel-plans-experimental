# GRAVEL GOD VOICE — EDGE CASE CODIFICATIONS

Additions to the core Voice + Narrative Sheet. Same rules, extended to specific situations.

---

## SECTION 7 — CONTENT-TYPE CALIBRATION

The voice stays consistent. The *function* shifts.

### 7.1 Marketplace Descriptions (Selling)

**Function:** Convince without begging.

- Lead with the problem the athlete already knows they have
- State what the plan does—no inflation
- Confidence reads as competence; hype reads as desperation
- One philosophical line max; the rest is practical value
- End on outcome, not enthusiasm

**Avoid:** Urgency tactics, superlatives, anything that sounds like late-night TV.

**Example opening:**
"You have 12 weeks. You need a plan that respects your time and doesn't assume you live at the gym. This is that plan."

---

### 7.2 Training Guides (Teaching)

**Function:** Transfer knowledge without lecturing.

- Assume the athlete is smart but hasn't thought about this specific thing yet
- Explain the "why" once, clearly, then move on
- Use the philosophical swerve sparingly—this is where it lands hardest
- Practical sections should feel like a capable friend walking you through something
- No dumbing down; no showing off

**Avoid:** Academic tone, excessive caveats, over-explaining basics.

**Example passage:**
"Heat adaptation isn't complicated. Expose yourself to heat. Repeat. Your body figures out the rest. The hard part is trusting a process that feels like failure for the first two weeks."

---

### 7.3 Workout Text (Instructing Mid-Effort)

**Function:** Guide without distraction.

- Shortest possible sentences
- Present tense, imperative mood
- No philosophy—athlete is suffering, not pondering
- Occasional dry humor is fine; it should land in under five words
- Cue the body, not the mind

**Avoid:** Motivation-speak, rhetorical questions, anything requiring cognitive effort.

**Example:**
"Hold this. Steady legs. The burn is the point."

**Not:**
"Remember why you started this journey and dig deep to find your inner strength!"

---

### 7.4 Race Previews (Informing + Preparing)

**Function:** Make the unknown known.

- Terrain and logistics first
- Honest difficulty assessment—no sandbagging, no inflation
- Specific mile/km markers where things change
- Local knowledge > generic advice
- One "what this race is really about" insight per piece

**Avoid:** Travel-brochure language, manufactured drama.

**Example:**
"Miles 80–95 are where Unbound breaks people. Not because it's the hardest terrain—it's not—but because you've been riding for seven hours and the road turns to peanut butter."

---

### 7.5 Email/Nurture Sequences (Relationship-Building)

**Function:** Stay useful without overstaying.

- Every email should contain one actionable thing or one insight worth remembering
- No "just checking in" energy
- Subject lines: clear > clever
- Treat inbox space as borrowed, not owned
- Unsubscribe is fine; being annoying is not

**Avoid:** False urgency, countdown timers, "You won't believe..." hooks.

**Example subject line:**
"One thing most Unbound plans get wrong"

**Not:**
"🔥 Don't miss this! Your Unbound prep starts NOW 🔥"

---

## SECTION 8 — TIER VOICE HANDLING

Same voice. Different assumptions about the reader.

### 8.1 The Principle

The Gravel God voice doesn't soften for beginners or harden for elites. It adjusts *context density*—how much it assumes versus explains.

| Tier | Assumption Level | Explanation Depth |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Ayahuasca | Low | High—define terms, explain rationale |
| Finisher | Medium | Medium—brief rationale, trust basics |
| Compete | High | Low—state the what, imply the why |
| Podium | Very High | Minimal—peer-to-peer shorthand |

---

### 8.2 Ayahuasca (0–5 hrs/week)

**Reader profile:** New to structured training, possibly intimidated, wants to finish—not compete.

**Adjustments:**
- Define training terms on first use (FTP, TSS, RPE)
- More scaffolding before paradoxes—earn the right to be cryptic
- Emphasize what success looks like at *their* level
- Never condescend; assume intelligence, not experience
- Slightly more "here's why this matters" before "here's what to do"

**Example:**
"RPE stands for Rate of Perceived Exertion—basically, how hard does this feel on a scale of 1 to 10. We use it because your legs don't read power meters. They just know effort."

---

### 8.3 Finisher (8–12 hrs/week)

**Reader profile:** Has trained before, understands the basics, wants a solid race—not just survival.

**Adjustments:**
- Terms can be used with brief parenthetical if ambiguous
- Philosophy and paradoxes land well here—they've lived some of it
- More "here's the nuance you might have missed"
- Can reference common mistakes they've probably made

**Example:**
"You've done intervals before. But most riders go too hard on the easy days, which means they go too easy on the hard days. This plan fixes that."

---

### 8.4 Compete (12–18 hrs/week)

**Reader profile:** Experienced, self-aware, chasing a meaningful result.

**Adjustments:**
- Minimal explanation; state the principle and move
- Assume familiarity with periodization, nutrition timing, race tactics
- Can be more direct about trade-offs ("this will hurt, it's supposed to")
- Peer tone: you're both in on the same game

**Example:**
"Week 8 is the peak stress week. You'll feel flat by Thursday. That's the plan working—not a sign it's broken."

---

### 8.5 Podium (18+ hrs/week)

**Reader profile:** High-level athlete, likely has coached or self-coached before, wants marginal gains.

**Adjustments:**
- Near-zero explanation; assume everything
- Shorthand is fine; they speak the language
- Focus on decision-making frameworks, not prescriptions
- Respect their autonomy—offer logic, not orders
- Can be blunter about what separates finishers from contenders

**Example:**
"If you're not willing to bury yourself in Week 10, reconsider your goal. This tier assumes you are."

---

## SECTION 9 — WARMTH REGISTER

The voice is dry, not cold. There's a difference.

### 9.1 Default Mode: Dry + Amused

This is the everyday register. Peer-to-peer, slightly wry, assumes resilience.

Works for: Training content, race previews, technical guidance, marketplace copy.

---

### 9.2 Warmer Gear: Grounded + Direct

**When to use:**
- Athlete is struggling (injury, burnout, life chaos)
- Addressing failure or disappointment
- Mental skills content where vulnerability is the subject
- Anything involving identity, confidence, or quitting

**What changes:**
- Humor recedes (not eliminated, but less frequent)
- More declarative reassurance
- Shorter sentences
- Directness increases—no dancing around the thing
- Empathy without pity

**What stays the same:**
- No motivational-poster language
- No toxic positivity
- No "you've got this!" empty affirmations
- Still treats the athlete as capable

**Example (dry mode):**
"Your race fell apart. It happens. Let's figure out why."

**Example (warmer gear):**
"A DNF is data, not a verdict. You're not broken. Something broke—we find it, we fix it, we go again."

---

### 9.3 Coldest Gear: Sparse + Unflinching

**When to use:**
- Athlete needs a reality check
- Pattern of avoidance or excuse-making
- High-stakes moment requiring clarity
- When kindness would be dishonest

**What changes:**
- Even shorter sentences
- No softening qualifiers
- Let the statement sit—don't apologize for it
- Trust silence after the point

**Example:**
"You skipped four weeks of training and want to know if you can still race. You can. You'll suffer more than you needed to. That's the cost."

---

### 9.4 The Non-Negotiable

In all registers, the voice never:
- Talks down to the athlete
- Uses empty encouragement as filler
- Pretends hard things are easy
- Shames without offering a path forward
- Abandons the reader in the difficulty

Warmth in GG isn't softness. It's steadiness when things are hard.

---

## SECTION 10 — BRAND TERMINOLOGY INTEGRATION

### 10.1 Core Terms

| Term | Meaning | Introduction Rule |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| G Spot | 88–92% FTP training zone | Define once with rationale, then use freely |
| Ayahuasca | 0–5 hr/week tier | Name the tier + hours on first use, then just the name |
| Finisher | 8–12 hr/week tier | Same as above |
| Compete | 12–18 hr/week tier | Same as above |
| Podium | 18+ hr/week tier | Same as above |
| Gravel God | The brand/system | Capitalize, never abbreviate to "GG" in athlete-facing content |

---

### 10.2 Introduction Patterns

**First use (any document):**
"The Finisher tier (8–12 hours per week) is built for athletes who..."

**Subsequent uses:**
"Finisher athletes should expect..."

**Cross-referencing tiers:**
"If Finisher volume feels unsustainable, drop to Ayahuasca—no shame, just math."

---

### 10.3 G Spot Specific Handling

This term needs slightly more care because it's a proprietary reframe of a common concept.

**First introduction:**
"We call it the G Spot: 88–92% of FTP. It's where gravel fitness actually lives—hard enough to create adaptation, sustainable enough to repeat. Sweet Spot is a marketing term. This is the version that works."

**Subsequent uses:**
"Three G Spot intervals, eight minutes each."

**Never:**
- Overexplain it every time
- Apologize for the name
- Use "Sweet Spot" as a synonym

---

### 10.4 Tier Philosophy Naming

Each tier has an implicit philosophy. These don't need to be named constantly, but they inform the content:

| Tier | Implicit Philosophy |
|------|---------------------|
| Ayahuasca | Completion is victory |
| Finisher | Prepared is powerful |
| Compete | Discomfort is data |
| Podium | Margins matter |

Use these as thematic guides, not taglines.

---

---

## SECTION 12 — QUICK REFERENCE: VOICE DECISION TREE

When in doubt, ask:

1. **Who is the reader right now?**
   → Determines tier calibration

2. **What are they trying to do?**
   → Determines content-type mode

3. **What emotional state might they be in?**
   → Determines warmth register

4. **Have I introduced the terms I'm using?**
   → Determines terminology handling

5. **Am I within the length target?**
   → Determines editing needs

6. **Does this feel sweaty?**
   → If yes, cut. If no, ship.
