    "summary": "Belgian Waffle Ride earns its 'Hell of the North County' nickname through relentless variety rather than single massive climbs. The course delivers 10,000+ feet of climbing across 120-135 miles mixing 50% pavement with 50% 'unroad'—dirt, gravel, single-track, sand, water crossings, and rock gardens. Founder Michael Marckx designed the route to expose riders who rely on draft in group rides but lack comprehensive bike handling and endurance skills. The 40% DNF rate validates the course's effectiveness at separating technical riders from pure power athletes, maintaining BWR's identity as an 'un-road' race rather than a pure gravel endurance test."
