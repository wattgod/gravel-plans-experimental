The DFL gets the biggest trophy. The community shows up like their lives depend on it. And the weather? The weather does whatever Oklahoma wants. When it's dry, you get a blazing-fast tactical race. When it's wet, you get an unrideable mud nightmare. Either way, you finish to live music, local beer, and a town that genuinely wants you there. This isn't the hardest gravel race. It's not the longest. But it might be the one with the biggest heart."
