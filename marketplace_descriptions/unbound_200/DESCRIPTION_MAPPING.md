## UPDATING TRAININGPEAKS DESCRIPTIONS

### Step-by-Step Process

**For each of your 15 plans:**

1. Log into TrainingPeaks marketplace
2. Navigate to your plan listing
3. Click "Edit" on the marketplace description
4. Open the corresponding `.txt` file from the mapping above
5. Copy the entire description (everything in the file)
6. Paste into TrainingPeaks description field
7. Save the listing

**Time estimate:** 5 minutes per plan × 15 = ~75 minutes total

---

## TESTING ALTERNATIVES

If you want to A/B test different descriptions:

1. Check your TrainingPeaks analytics for which plans are converting
2. For underperforming plans, swap in an alternative description
3. Wait 2-4 weeks for meaningful data
4. Keep the winner

**Example:**
- Finisher Advanced not converting well?
- Try `finisher_sub_12_hours.txt` instead of `finisher_advanced.txt`
- See if performance-specific copy converts better

---

## NOTES

**Masters variations:**
- beginner_masters = Conservative, first-time Masters athlete
- intermediate_masters = Default/safe choice for most Masters
- advanced_masters = Competitive Masters athlete with experience

**Save My Race variations:**
- Only one variation per tier
- These descriptions address the 6-week late-start scenario
- Same copy works across experience levels within tier

**Podium GOAT:**
- "GOAT" = Greatest Of All Time = Elite performance
- elite.txt emphasizes highest performance expectations
- pro_level.txt also works if you want slightly less aggressive tone
- win_attempt.txt is most aggressive ("expecting to podium")
