# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. Pacing strategy. Fueling under fatigue. Mental protocols when it hurts. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. I built this plan to fix that. Every session has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting. This plan gives you the structure serious amateurs need without the guesswork most training programs leave behind.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Recovery architecture** designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb
- **Race execution playbook** covering pacing, fueling under fatigue, and group dynamics (Section 10)
- **VO2max intervals** that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering
- **Precision taper protocol** with deload timing proven for competitive athletes (Section 12)
- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical decision-making and suffering management systems
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail VO2max, threshold, and G Spot (88-92% FTP) sessions
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — Progressive overload system with clear intensity targets
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Advanced bike handling for aggressive racing on rough terrain

## The Alternative

You could hire a generic coach who gives you cookie-cutter workouts. They don't understand gravel. They don't understand your specific limiters. You pay for training you could've Googled.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
