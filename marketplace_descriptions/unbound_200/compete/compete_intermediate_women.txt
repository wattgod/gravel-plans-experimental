# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Polarized training principles work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability, enough intensity to sharpen performance, and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's what this plan does differently: it teaches you to execute races, not just finish trained. Pacing strategy (Section 10), fueling under fatigue (Section 8), mental protocols when it hurts (Section 9). Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Periodized intensity** with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering
- **VO2max intervals** that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering
- **G Spot work** (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot
- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)
- **Recovery architecture** designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail VO2max, threshold, and G Spot (88-92% FTP) sessions
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Periodization principles that create predictable performance
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — Progressive overload system with clear intensity targets
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical decision-making and suffering management systems
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices

## The Alternative

The alternative is self-coaching with no framework. You follow your instincts. Your instincts say train harder. You do. You get slower. You don't know why.

## Real Numbers

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
