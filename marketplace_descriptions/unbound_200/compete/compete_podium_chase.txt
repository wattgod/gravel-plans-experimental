# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. Pacing strategy. Fueling under fatigue. Mental protocols when it hurts. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because you've been stuck. Same training, same results, can't figure out why the next level won't arrive. The answer is usually simple: your training stopped challenging your current fitness. This plan uses progressive overload correctly—not just adding volume, but strategically increasing demands where they create adaptation. You'll work harder than before, but smarter than ever.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)
- **Precision taper protocol** with deload timing proven for competitive athletes (Section 12)
- **G Spot work** (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot
- **Periodized intensity** with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering
- **9-hour dress rehearsal** validating everything from nutrition to power distribution at race intensity

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail VO2max, threshold, and G Spot (88-92% FTP) sessions
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Advanced bike handling for aggressive racing on rough terrain
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Periodization principles that create predictable performance

## The Alternative

You're training 12-18 hours. You're fit. But you're not getting the results your fitness says you should. Usually that's methodology: wrong intensity distribution, poor pacing, or bad taper.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 12-18 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
