# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. Pacing strategy. Fueling under fatigue. Mental protocols when it hurts. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this using polarized training principles because they work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability (12-18 hours), enough intensity to sharpen performance (Zone 4-5 sessions), and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target on a specific date.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)
- **Periodized intensity** with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering
- **Race execution playbook** covering pacing, fueling under fatigue, and group dynamics (Section 10)
- **9-hour dress rehearsal** validating everything from nutrition to power distribution at race intensity
- **Recovery architecture** designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Advanced bike handling for aggressive racing on rough terrain
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — Race-pace fueling protocols that work under fatigue
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical decision-making and suffering management systems

## The Alternative

Most people at your volume plateau: same training, same results, year after year. They never break through because they never change the stimulus.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
