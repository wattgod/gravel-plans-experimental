# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. Every session here has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. I built this plan to fix that. Every session has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting. This plan gives you the structure serious amateurs need without the guesswork most training programs leave behind.

## This Plan Includes:

- **G Spot work** (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot
- **9-hour dress rehearsal** validating everything from nutrition to power distribution at race intensity
- **VO2max intervals** that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering
- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)
- **Periodized intensity** with dedicated base, build, and peak phases—no more year-round threshold hammering

## Your Training Guide Covers:

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
