# Unbound Gravel 200 — Compete (12-18 hours/week)

Polarized training principles work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability, enough intensity to sharpen performance, and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because you've been stuck. Same training, same results, can't figure out why the next level won't arrive. The answer is usually simple: your training stopped challenging your current fitness. This plan uses progressive overload correctly—not just adding volume, but strategically increasing demands where they create adaptation. You'll work harder than before, but smarter than ever.

## This Plan Includes:

- **VO2max intervals** that actually improve race performance—not just training-day suffering
- **Recovery architecture** designed for 12-18 hour weeks—enough stress to adapt, enough rest to absorb
- **Mental training system** for suffering management and tactical decision-making (Section 9)
- **G Spot work** (88-92% FTP)—gravel-specific race-pace training superior to generic Sweet Spot
- **Race execution playbook** covering pacing, fueling under fatigue, and group dynamics (Section 10)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical decision-making and suffering management systems
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Periodization principles that create predictable performance
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat protocols, altitude adaptation (if needed), equipment choices
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution playbook covering pacing, group dynamics, and attack timing
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — Race-pace fueling protocols that work under fatigue

## The Alternative

Without a structured plan, you're guessing: Am I training hard enough? Too hard? Is my taper right? You won't know until race day. By then it's too late.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 12-18 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
