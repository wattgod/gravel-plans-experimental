# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan unlocks it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. I built it for people who want their fitness to show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. The result is performance that arrives when you need it—not when luck decides.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression

## The Alternative

Or you hire a coach who doesn't understand gravel racing. They give you road intervals and century training. You finish Unbound but never learn to race it.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
