# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This isn't a generic century plan with 'gravel' stuck on top. It's designed for variable-pace racing on rough terrain. Technical skills. Fueling protocols that work when you're getting rattled. Power distribution strategies for 10+ hour efforts. Everything here is calibrated for what Unbound actually demands.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this plan for people who've tried coaching themselves and know it's hard to maintain consistency. The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed

## The Alternative

You could keep winging it: sometimes you train hard, sometimes you don't. You arrive at Unbound with whatever fitness randomly accumulated. Usually it's not enough.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
