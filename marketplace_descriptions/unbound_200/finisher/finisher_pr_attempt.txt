# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash

## The Alternative

You could keep doing what you've been doing: finishing races without ever racing them. Survival mode. Getting dropped. Wondering why your fitness doesn't translate.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
