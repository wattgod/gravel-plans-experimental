# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This isn't a generic century plan with 'gravel' stuck on top. It's designed for variable-pace racing on rough terrain. Technical skills. Fueling protocols that work when you're getting rattled. Power distribution strategies for 10+ hour efforts. Everything here is calibrated for what Unbound actually demands.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's what separates this from generic century plans: it's designed for gravel racing, not road endurance. That means technical skills (Section 7), fueling protocols that work on rough terrain (Section 8), and power distribution strategies for variable-pace events (Section 10). You're not just getting fitter—you're getting faster at the specific thing Unbound demands.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong

## The Alternative

Most people at your level train by feel: go out, ride hard, come home tired. No zones. No progression. No plan. They finish events but never improve.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
