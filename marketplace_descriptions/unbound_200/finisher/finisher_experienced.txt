# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. Training zones are scientific but simple. Workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this plan for people who've tried coaching themselves and know it's hard to maintain consistency. The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed

## The Alternative

Most people train just enough to survive the distance. They don't train to compete. They show up, get dropped early, and spend 12 hours alone.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
