# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This isn't a generic century plan with 'gravel' stuck on top. It's designed for variable-pace racing on rough terrain. Technical skills. Fueling protocols that work when you're getting rattled. Power distribution strategies for 10+ hour efforts. Everything here is calibrated for what Unbound actually demands.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong

## The Alternative

Most people at your level train by feel: go out, ride hard, come home tired. No zones. No progression. No plan. They finish events but never improve.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
