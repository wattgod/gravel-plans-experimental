# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. Training zones are scientific but simple. Workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Polarized principles that build both endurance and speed
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression

## The Alternative

Most people train just enough to survive the distance. They don't train to compete. They show up, get dropped early, and spend 12 hours alone.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
