# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

Finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—in the right order, in the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly

## The Alternative

Without structure, you accumulate fatigue without accumulating fitness. Tired all the time. Never sharp. Performance stays flat while effort stays high.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
