# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. I built it for people who want their fitness to show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. The result is performance that arrives when you need it—not when luck decides.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)
- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly

## The Alternative

Most people train just enough to survive the distance. They don't train to compete. They show up, get dropped early, and spend 12 hours alone.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
