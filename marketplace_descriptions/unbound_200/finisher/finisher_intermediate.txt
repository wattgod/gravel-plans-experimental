# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

This isn't a generic century plan with 'gravel' stuck on top. It's designed for variable-pace racing on rough terrain. Technical skills. Fueling protocols that work when you're getting rattled. Power distribution strategies for 10+ hour efforts. Everything here is calibrated for what Unbound actually demands.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—but in the right order and the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering. Everything here is calibrated to create race-day capacity, not training-day heroics.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Pacing strategy for 10-14 hours—how to start conservatively and finish strong
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash

## The Alternative

The alternative is free training plans from cycling forums: generic workouts, no race-specific prep, no guidance on execution. You follow them hoping they work.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
