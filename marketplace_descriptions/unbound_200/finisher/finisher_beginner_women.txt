# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan unlocks it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's what separates this from generic century plans: it's designed for gravel racing, not road endurance. That means technical skills (Section 7), fueling protocols that work on rough terrain (Section 8), and power distribution strategies for variable-pace events (Section 10). You're not just getting fitter—you're getting faster at the specific thing Unbound demands.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)
- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Dress rehearsal ride** at 7 hours validating fueling, pacing, and equipment choices
- **Progressive overload system** with clear weekly targets—intensity increases predictably, not randomly
- **Technical skills curriculum** covering cornering, descending, and rough-terrain bike handling (Section 7)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Bike handling that keeps you upright and moving when others crash
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains

## The Alternative

You could keep winging it: sometimes you train hard, sometimes you don't. You arrive at Unbound with whatever fitness randomly accumulated. Usually it's not enough.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 8-12 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
