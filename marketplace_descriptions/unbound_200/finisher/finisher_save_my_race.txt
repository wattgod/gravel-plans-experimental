# Unbound Gravel 200 — Finisher (8-12 hours/week)

The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people ready to stop surviving and start racing. You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Heat adaptation weeks** (6-10) that improve performance 5-8% through controlled exposure (Section 11)
- **Structured taper** in final 2 weeks—proven protocol that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Race-specific power zones** calibrated from YOUR FTP, with RPE guidance when power isn't available (Section 5)
- **Pacing strategy guide** for 10-14 hour efforts—how to start conservatively and finish strong (Section 10)
- **Polarized training distribution** that builds both durability (Zone 2) and speed (Zone 4-5)—no more junk miles

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to execute intervals, tempo rides, and endurance sessions correctly
- **Race-Specific Preparation (Section 11)** — Heat adaptation weeks (6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Proven taper sequence that peaks fitness without losing form
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — Precise power targets and RPE guidance for structured progression
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — How base, build, and peak phases stack together for race day

## The Alternative

You could keep winging it: sometimes you train hard, sometimes you don't. You arrive at Unbound with whatever fitness randomly accumulated. Usually it's not enough.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
