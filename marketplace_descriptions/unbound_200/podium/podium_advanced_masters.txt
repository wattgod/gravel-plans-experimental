# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

You've been your own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But self-coaching has blind spots—especially recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)
- **Taper discipline** that prevents panic-training and delivers peak performance on race day
- **10-hour dress rehearsal** at race intensity—full validation of systems, fueling, pacing, equipment

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical systems for high-pressure racing and suffering management
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait

## The Alternative

Without structure, high volume becomes high injury risk. You know this. You've dealt with overtraining before. But self-coaching makes it easy to ignore the warning signs.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 18+ hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
