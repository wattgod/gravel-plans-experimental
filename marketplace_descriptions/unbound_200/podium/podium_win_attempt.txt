# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

You've been your own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But self-coaching has blind spots—especially recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's why this plan works at elite volume: it balances polarized intensity with race-specific demands. You need sustainable power (Zone 2 base), repeatable efforts (threshold work), and explosive capacity (VO2max sessions). Most high-volume plans just pile on endurance. This one builds a complete athlete. That's what Unbound rewards—not just who can suffer longest, but who can attack when it matters.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Taper discipline** that prevents panic-training and delivers peak performance on race day
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)
- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)
- **Heat adaptation protocol** (Weeks 6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains through systematic exposure

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training

## The Alternative

The alternative is following your instincts: train hard every day, skip recovery when you feel good, add volume when you panic. It's a great way to arrive overtrained.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
