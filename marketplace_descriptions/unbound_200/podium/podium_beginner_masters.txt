# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed heat adaptation, who got fueling dialed, who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.

## This Plan Includes:

- **10-hour dress rehearsal** at race intensity—full validation of systems, fueling, pacing, equipment
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)
- **VO2max sessions** calibrated for repeatability over 10+ hours—not just 5-minute power
- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — Periodized progression with threshold blocks and VO2max phases
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait

## The Alternative

Most podium-level athletes have the fitness. They just don't have the discipline. This plan provides the structure to stay disciplined when instincts say otherwise.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
