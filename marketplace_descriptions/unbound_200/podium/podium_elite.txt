# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

This plan wasn't built for people hoping to podium—it was built for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no 'close enough' on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people who've been their own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But you also know that self-coaching has blind spots—especially when it comes to recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more. Sometimes the best coach tells you to back off.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Heat adaptation protocol** (Weeks 6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains through systematic exposure
- **Polarized volume distribution** with 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5—proven elite training principle
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)
- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — Recovery metrics that prevent overtraining while maximizing adaptation
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait

## The Alternative

Without a plan, 18+ hours of training can go either way: perfect preparation or systematic overtraining. The difference is structure you actually follow.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 18+ hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
