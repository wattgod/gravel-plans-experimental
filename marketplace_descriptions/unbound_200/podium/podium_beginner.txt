# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

Most plans at 18+ hours just add more work. This one adds more precision. At this volume, training quality determines results—not quantity. Every session has a specific purpose. Every recovery day is strategic. The difference between podium and pack is who trains most intelligently over 12 weeks without breaking.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)
- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **Polarized volume distribution** with 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5—proven elite training principle
- **Taper discipline** that prevents panic-training and delivers peak performance on race day
- **VO2max sessions** calibrated for repeatability over 10+ hours—not just 5-minute power

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical systems for high-pressure racing and suffering management
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5

## The Alternative

The alternative is training by feel at elite volume: lots of work, questionable recovery, taper decided by panic rather than protocol. It's a coin flip whether you're sharp on race day.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 18+ hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
