# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

This plan wasn't built for people hoping to podium—it was built for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no 'close enough' on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I didn't build this for people hoping to podium. I built it for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no "close enough" on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you. At this level, coaching provides the roadmap. You still have to drive. But if you're serious about results, this gets you there.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Heat adaptation protocol** (Weeks 6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains through systematic exposure
- **Polarized volume distribution** with 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5—proven elite training principle
- **10-hour dress rehearsal** at race intensity—full validation of systems, fueling, pacing, equipment
- **Taper discipline** that prevents panic-training and delivers peak performance on race day
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — Recovery metrics that prevent overtraining while maximizing adaptation
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — Periodized progression with threshold blocks and VO2max phases
- **Race Tactics (Section 10)** — Execution strategies for podium-level competition—when to attack, when to wait
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5

## The Alternative

The alternative is training by feel at elite volume: lots of work, questionable recovery, taper decided by panic rather than protocol. It's a coin flip whether you're sharp on race day.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 18+ hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
