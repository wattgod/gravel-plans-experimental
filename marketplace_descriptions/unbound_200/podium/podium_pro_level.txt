# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

This plan balances polarized intensity with race-specific demands. You need sustainable power (Zone 2 base), repeatable efforts (threshold work), and explosive capacity (VO2max sessions). Most high-volume plans just pile on endurance. This one builds a complete athlete.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most plans at this volume just add more work. I built this one to add more precision. At 18+ hours a week, training quality determines results—not quantity. Every session here has a specific purpose. Every recovery day is strategic. The difference between podium and pack isn't who trains hardest—it's who trains most intelligently over 12 weeks without breaking.

## This Plan Includes:

- **10-hour dress rehearsal** at race intensity—full validation of systems, fueling, pacing, equipment
- **Taper discipline** that prevents panic-training and delivers peak performance on race day
- **Altitude protocols** for high-elevation races—if Unbound location demands it (conditional section)
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)
- **Heat adaptation protocol** (Weeks 6-10) delivering 5-8% performance gains through systematic exposure

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Race-winning bike handling—cornering speeds and descending lines that matter
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical systems for high-pressure racing and suffering management

## The Alternative

Most elite-level athletes overtrain because they don't have external accountability. They push when they should rest. They panic-train through taper. They arrive at races tired.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
