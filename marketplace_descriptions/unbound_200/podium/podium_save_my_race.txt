# Unbound Gravel 200 — Podium (18+ hours/week)

You've been your own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But self-coaching has blind spots—especially recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this because Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed their heat adaptation (Weeks 6-10), who got their fueling dialed (60-80g/hour), who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3. Everyone at the front is fit. Not everyone is ready.

## This Plan Includes:

- **10-hour dress rehearsal** at race intensity—full validation of systems, fueling, pacing, equipment
- **Recovery metrics** that prevent overtraining—when to push, when to back off (Section 6)
- **Polarized volume distribution** with 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5—proven elite training principle
- **Threshold blocks** that build sustainable race pace without overtraining
- **VO2max sessions** calibrated for repeatability over 10+ hours—not just 5-minute power

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — Elite training principles: 80% Zone 2, 20% Zone 4-5
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Tactical systems for high-pressure racing and suffering management
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g/hour protocols tested at race intensity, not training pace
- **Your 12-Week Arc (Section 4)** — Periodized progression with threshold blocks and VO2max phases
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Taper discipline that delivers peak performance, not panic training

## The Alternative

Without a plan, 18+ hours of training can go either way: perfect preparation or systematic overtraining. The difference is structure you actually follow.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 18+ hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
