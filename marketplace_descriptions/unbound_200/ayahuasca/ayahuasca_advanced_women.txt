# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

The pros don't finish Unbound because they train 25 hours a week. They train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. Four hours of structured training beats eight hours of riding around. This plan builds race-ready fitness without pretending you're someone you're not.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Race-pace power targets** calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume

## The Alternative

You could follow free plans designed for people with unlimited time. Skip half the workouts. Feel guilty about it. Show up wondering if you did enough.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
