# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this plan for people who are making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Taper protocol** designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume

## The Alternative

Most training plans assume 10-15 hours per week. You try to cram them into 4. You get tired, not faster. You skip workouts because they don't fit. You show up at Unbound undertrained and hoping for luck.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 0-5 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
