# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Taper protocol** designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes

## The Alternative

The alternative is showing up at Unbound with whatever fitness you stumbled into. No heat adaptation. No fueling practice. No skills work. Just hope and determination.

## Real Numbers

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
