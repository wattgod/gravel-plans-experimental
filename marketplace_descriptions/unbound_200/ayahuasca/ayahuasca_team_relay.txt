# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

Everyone says 'train smarter, not harder' when they mean 'just ride more.' This plan actually delivers: intensity that creates adaptation, skills that prevent disasters, recovery that lets you absorb the work. It's built for limited hours and unlimited determination.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I didn't build this plan to get you on a podium. I built it to get you across the line feeling like you raced, not survived. That requires a specific training approach: sessions short enough to recover from, intense enough to create change, and focused enough to build the skills Unbound actually demands. Most plans ignore this because they're template workouts scaled down. This one was built from scratch for your constraints.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Race-pace power targets** calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes

## The Alternative

The alternative is DIY training: copying workouts from Reddit, following random Strava rides, hoping volume alone will save you. It won't. Unbound rewards specific fitness, not general cycling.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 0-5 hours/week

- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
