# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this plan for people who are making this work around a life, not building a life around this. You've got 4-5 hours. Maybe 6 on a good week. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan respects that. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler, no fluff, no pretending you're someone you're not.

## This Plan Includes:

- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes
- **Race-pace power targets** calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them

## The Alternative

Or you train randomly: hard when you feel good, easy when you don't. No structure. No progression. No plan. You arrive at Unbound hoping fitness magically appeared.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
