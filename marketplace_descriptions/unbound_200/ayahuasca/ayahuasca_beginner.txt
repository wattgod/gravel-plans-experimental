# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

Everyone says 'train smarter, not harder' when they mean 'just ride more.' This plan actually delivers: intensity that creates adaptation, skills that prevent disasters, recovery that lets you absorb the work. It's built for limited hours and unlimited determination.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most plans for Unbound are written for people with 12+ hours a week. This one isn't. I built this because cramming high-volume training into a low-volume week doesn't make you faster—it makes you tired. The workouts here are designed for maximum adaptation with minimum time. Every session has a purpose. None of them assume you have hours to waste.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Race-pace power targets** calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes
- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions

## The Alternative

The alternative is showing up at Unbound with whatever fitness you stumbled into. No heat adaptation. No fueling practice. No skills work. Just hope and determination.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
