# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

The pros don't finish Unbound because they train 25 hours a week. They train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. Four hours of structured training beats eight hours of riding around. This plan builds race-ready fitness without pretending you're someone you're not.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions

## The Alternative

Without a plan, you wing it. Ride when you can. Go hard sometimes. Rest when life forces you to. That's not training. That's hoping for the best.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
