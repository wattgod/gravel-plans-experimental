# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

The pros don't finish Unbound because they train 25 hours a week. They train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. Four hours of structured training beats eight hours of riding around. This plan builds race-ready fitness without pretending you're someone you're not.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people who have 4 hours and a dream. The math doesn't work—you know that, I know that. But I also know you're showing up anyway. So instead of pretending those 4 hours can magically become 12, I built a plan that makes every single one of them count. Quality over quantity isn't a compromise here. It's the only strategy that works.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes
- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume
- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions

## The Alternative

The alternative is showing up at Unbound with whatever fitness you stumbled into. No heat adaptation. No fueling practice. No skills work. Just hope and determination.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
