# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Most plans for Unbound are written for people with 12+ hours a week. This one isn't. I built this because cramming high-volume training into a low-volume week doesn't make you faster—it makes you tired. The workouts here are designed for maximum adaptation with minimum time. Every session has a purpose. None of them assume you have hours to waste.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **High-efficiency workouts** designed for maximum adaptation in minimal time—every session under 90 minutes

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions
- **Technical Skills (Section 7)** — Cornering, descending, rough terrain—skills that prevent race-ending mechanicals
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required

## The Alternative

The alternative is showing up at Unbound with whatever fitness you stumbled into. No heat adaptation. No fueling practice. No skills work. Just hope and determination.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
