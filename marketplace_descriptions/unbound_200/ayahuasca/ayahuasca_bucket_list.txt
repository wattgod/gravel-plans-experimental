# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I didn't build this plan to get you on a podium. I built it to get you across the line feeling like you raced, not survived. That requires a specific training approach: sessions short enough to recover from, intense enough to create change, and focused enough to build the skills Unbound actually demands. Most plans ignore this because they're template workouts scaled down. This one was built from scratch for your constraints.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Strategic recovery** that doesn't assume you have 12+ hours to absorb training stress
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Taper protocol** designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes

## The Alternative

You could follow free plans designed for people with unlimited time. Skip half the workouts. Feel guilty about it. Show up wondering if you did enough.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
