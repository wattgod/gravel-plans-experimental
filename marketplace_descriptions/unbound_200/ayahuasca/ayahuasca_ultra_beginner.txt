# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

I built this for people who have 4 hours and a dream. The math doesn't work—you know that, I know that. But I also know you're showing up anyway. So instead of pretending those 4 hours can magically become 12, I built a plan that makes every single one of them count. Quality over quantity isn't a compromise here. It's the only strategy that works.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Skills-first approach** that prevents mechanical failures and crashes from killing your race (Section 7)
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)
- **Taper protocol** designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Race Week Protocol (Section 12)** — Final prep that doesn't assume you have time for elaborate tapers
- **Fueling & Hydration (Section 8)** — 60-80g carbs/hour protocol tested on limited training volume
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions
- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them

## The Alternative

Without a plan, you wing it. Ride when you can. Go hard sometimes. Rest when life forces you to. That's not training. That's hoping for the best.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 0-5 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
