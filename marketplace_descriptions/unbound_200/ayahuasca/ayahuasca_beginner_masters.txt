# Unbound Gravel 200 — Ayahuasca (0-5 hours/week)

You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.

## What You Get

**84 structured workouts** across 12 weeks. Every session labeled for Zwift, TrainerRoad, or outdoor execution. No guessing what to do. No wondering if it's working.

Here's why this plan works with limited hours: it's built on intensity distribution that actually creates adaptation, not volume accumulation that creates fatigue. The pros aren't faster because they train 25 hours—they train 25 hours because they're pros. You need a different engine. This plan builds it. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.

## This Plan Includes:

- **Outdoor options** for every workout—no trainer required, just structured execution
- **Taper protocol** designed for athletes who can't afford to lose fitness in rest weeks
- **Race-pace power targets** calibrated for your available training time, not fantasy watts
- **Dress rehearsal rides** at manageable duration (5 hours max) that still validate your race-day systems
- **Fueling protocols** tested on limited training volume—60-80g carbs/hour without GI distress (Section 8)

## Your Training Guide Covers:

- **Training Fundamentals (Section 3)** — First principles that work with limited hours, not against them
- **FAQ (Section 14)** — Answers to 'can I really finish with 4 hours/week?' and other honest questions
- **Workout Execution (Section 6)** — How to nail each session type in under 90 minutes
- **Training Zones (Section 5)** — FTP-based targets with RPE guidance—no power meter required
- **Mental Training (Section 9)** — Suffering management for 10+ hour efforts when your body isn't fully trained

## The Alternative

Without a plan, you wing it. Ride when you can. Go hard sometimes. Rest when life forces you to. That's not training. That's hoping for the best.

## Real Numbers

- **Duration:** 12 weeks (84 days of structured training)
- **Weekly volume:** 0-5 hours/week
- **Total workouts:** 84 sessions (indoor + outdoor options)
- **Training zones:** FTP-based with RPE guidance
- **Race-specific prep:** Unbound Gravel 200 terrain, fueling, tactics
- **Full guide:** 18,000+ words covering training, technical skills, race execution
- **Price:** $99

## What This Isn't

This isn't a generic training plan with "Unbound Gravel 200" stuck on top. It's designed for the specific demands of this race—terrain, distance, conditions. Every workout, every rest day, every taper choice is built around getting you ready for this event.

If you're looking for magic bullets or shortcuts, this won't deliver. If you're looking for structured training that respects reality and builds race-ready fitness, this is it.
