    "history": {
      "founded": 2012,
      "founder": "Michael Marckx (MMX)",
      "origin_story": "The Belgian Waffle Ride began as a marketing exercise in 2012 when Michael Marckx (MMX), then president of SPY Optic, invited 136 people to ride bikes on dirt roads through North County San Diego. Marckx brought diverse athletic credentials—UCI cyclocross pro license, professional triathlete competing alongside Mark Allen and Scott Tinley, marathon runner posting 2:40s at age 14. He wanted to create 'a 6-7-8-12 hour cyclocross race bracketed by Belgian waffles and Belgian ale,' mixing the cobbled brutality of Spring Classics with California's technical terrain. The origin story traces to childhood rebellion. Young Marckx took his road bike through dirt fields as a shortcut to school, passing eighth-grade bullies who yelled 'You can't ride that bike in the dirt.' His response: 'I just did.' BWR embodies this: it refuses the 'gravel race' label in favor of 'un-road,' mixes single-track with pavement, and rewards technical skill alongside fitness. The first event saw 118 of 136 finishers. Within three years, BWR had grown to 1,000+ participants. Today, the series spans multiple locations (California, Utah, North Carolina, British Columbia), but the original San Diego event—now based at Del Mar Polo Fields as of 2025—remains the flagship. The $50,000+ prize purse is the largest in one-day gravel racing, and the 40% DNF rate is nearly double Unbound's attrition. Marckx designed the course to expose riders who 'do the group rides that never do any work and then all of a sudden, they're there for the sprint.' BWR rewards those who can actually ride bikes, not just pedal them. Marckx speaks about transformation stories: 'I signed up for the Belgian Waffle Ride, and I haven't raced my bike in 30 years. And it literally transformed my body and my mindset.' These narratives drive him more than elite results. Fourteen editions in, BWR has become American gravel racing's technical standard.",
