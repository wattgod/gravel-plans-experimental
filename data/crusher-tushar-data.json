      "strengths": [
        "The scenery: Tushar Mountains are criminally underrated. World-class alpine beauty.",

      "reality": "Altitude doesn't care about your FTP. You can be a 4.5 w/kg rider at sea level and feel like a 3.5 at 10,000 feet. If you can't arrive early and adapt, you'll watch climbers you normally drop ride away from you.",
      "consequences": [
        "Travel to Beaver, Utah takes effort. No direct flights. Budget for a road trip.",
        "Altitude adaptation requires 3-7 days minimum. That's vacation time or remote work.",
