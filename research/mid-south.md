## TERRAIN & SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:** 98-99% unpaved, 1-2% pavement

**Geographic Context:**
- Cross Timbers ecoregion
- Tribal lands: Osage, Quapaw, Kickapoo, Wichita, Kiowa Nations
- Mix of prairie and woodland

**Geological Features:**
- Red dirt from iron oxide (pinkish hue)
- Significant clay content (especially western half)
- Sandstone outcroppings
- "Sunken roadbed" sections with sandstone walls

**Road Surface:**
- Clay hardback when dry = fast, hard-pack riding
- "Not the frighteningly chunky gravel you find in the Flint Hills at Unbound Gravel"
- "Dry and dusty" when conditions cooperate
- "Hard pack" riding = slick center tread tires work well

## WEATHER HISTORY & MUD REPUTATION

### 2025 (CANCELLED)
- Payne County wildfires
- 60 mph winds, Red Flag warning
- Saturday 4 AM: Race cancelled

### 2024
- Dry and dusty day
- Temperature: 52°F at start, ~3,000 people
- 917 riders finished 100-mile

### MUD REPUTATION YEARS
- "Many riders had to abandon the race as they couldn't get their wheels to spin due to mud!"
- Clay soil: "Clay can hold an incredible amount of water. It's heavy and very sticky"
- Course can become "impassable mud" with sustained rainfall
- "Peanut butter mud, making efficient progress nearly impossible"

## TIRE RECOMMENDATIONS

### DRY CONDITIONS (Most Common):
- **WTB Byway 40mm:** Slick center tread, "Efficient, with enough rubber"
- **WTB Byway 44mm:** "Better traction and more air volume for comfort"
- **Maxxis Reaver 40mm:** Full slick with tiny file tread
- **Specialized Pathfinder Pro 42-44mm:** Dual-compound (hard center, soft sides)

### WET/MUD CONDITIONS:
- **Kenda Kommando 32mm:** Cross-tire, narrower = less mud clogging in fork

### TIRE PRESSURE GUIDANCE:
- Pro Alex Howes: "High 20s PSI" for Mid South specifically
- Maxxis Reaver runner: "31-32 PSI start, by end of day 32-33 PSI"
- "Wide tire at lower pressures is your traction"

## RACE CHARACTER & VIBE

### Not Just a Race:
- "Big-tent gravel event" - 12-mile party riders to 100-mile racers

- "Weekend endurance festival" with live music, parties, expo
- Camaraderie emphasized constantly

### Diversity:
- Road bike racers + MTB riders

## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW"

1. "If you haven't ever been to the Mid South then you don't understand what that event is. It's not just a race or an event. It's a community."

2. "I still need my Bobby Hug!" - Common refrain from returning riders

3. Clay mud strategy: Narrower tires (32mm) in mud to prevent fork/frame clogging

4. "Weather can be unpredictable, occasionally these big races turn into chaotic experiences"

5. "None can replicate the experience I have at Mid South"
