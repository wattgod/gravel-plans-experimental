## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Located at the northern edge of Texas Hill Country, with “gorgeous” wildflower‑lined gravel roads and fast limestone surfaces that riders describe as “smooth” and “perfect for gravel.”[^1][^4][^10]
- TrainerRoad notes the course as mostly well‑packed limestone gravel with some pavement connectors, stressing that these roads handle water well unless conditions are extreme.[^10]

**Technical sections:**

- There are no singletrack or rock‑garden sections like Colorado; difficulty is more about relentless rollers, some chunkier gravel patches, and speed.[^4][^10]
- One notable feature is “Loco Hill” on the 60‑mile route, a short but steep punch that stands out as the main real climb on that distance.[^9]

**Notable climbs:**

- 150‑mile rider’s Garmin recorded 7,884 ft of climbing with many small hills, so climbing is distributed into endless rollers rather than a few big climbs.[^4]
- Loco Hill is repeatedly mentioned for the mid‑distance route; otherwise the profile is constant up‑and‑down rather than mountain passes.[^9]

**Problem areas:**

- In 2022, a brutal heat year, one aid station “after the 3B climbs” ran out of water and riders waited over 30 minutes; someone in a truck handed out water 20 miles before the finish, highlighting heat‑plus‑supply vulnerability.[^4]
- Heat and sun exposure on open ranch roads are flagged more often than sketchy surfaces; riders say the course itself is not super technical, but the weather and length make it hard.[^10][^9][^4]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Reported as “just about perfect this year”; riders mention great temps and conditions, calling the event fun and well‑supported. [^4] | Pro‑heavy field used it as ideal Unbound tune‑up; Velo’s 2024 recap doesn’t mention weather issues. [^6][^7] |
| 2023 | Described as “rough” by locals compared to 2024, but without the extreme heat of 2022; likely warmer, windier, and maybe more humid. [^4] | Some riders deferred from 2023 to 2024 because of prior year’s conditions. [^4] |
| 2022 | “The 2022 weather was hell. The fresh tarmac read like 120° on my Wahoo at some points AND they ran out of water after the 3B climbs.” – Reddit commenter. [^4] | Multiple riders suffered in extreme heat and at least one aid station ran dry; ad‑hoc water hand‑ups saved some riders. [^4] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Late May in central Texas often means starting in warm temps and climbing well into the 80s–90s F with high sun; Wahoo reading of 120°F on tarmac in 2022 shows how brutal heat reflection can be.[^9][^4]

**Primary risk:**

- Heat, sun, and insufficient hydration; Reddit users repeatedly call out heat as the “only thing that worries me” about the race.[^4][^9]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Essentially low altitude; classic Texas Hill Country elevations with rolling terrain, not mountains—heat and humidity, not oxygen, are the physiological challenge.[^1][^9]

- No deep Hico‑specific tech threads surfaced; most chatter is cross‑posted from r/gravelcycling or general event recs.[^10][^4]


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

**Thread:** “Gravel Locos 2022, Hico, TX”
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/gravel-locos-2022-hico-tx/70035[^8]
**Key quotes:**

- “If weather is really bad I may consider switching tires but if roads are limestone gravel they will handle water well.” – same thread, on wet‑weather behavior.[^10]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~60–90 (La Loca) | Mid‑race rolling Hill Country ranch roads | Heat typically spikes; shade is scarce, and if you’ve under‑drunk you start to unravel here while still far from home. [^4][^10] |  |
| After “3B climbs” (100‑mile route, 2022) | Sector before late aid that ran out of water | In 2022 heat year riders waited 30+ minutes at a dry aid; many were on the edge from 120°F tarmac readings and dehydration. [^4] |  |
| Final ascent into Hico | Rolling climb back into town | 150‑mile rider still felt the last climb after 7,884 ft; for under‑trained riders this is where cramps and mental fatigue hit hardest. [^4] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- Not a specific named hill but the **heat‑soaked late race**—especially 2022’s post‑3B‑climbs stretch—stands out as the defining suffer zone; in normal years, the cumulative rollers plus heat near the end are what people talk about.[^9][^4]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No precise percentages are published, but 2022’s “hell” year clearly boosted DNF rates with riders stopped at dry aid stations and exposed to 120°F tarmac; in more temperate years, finish rates are much higher.[^4]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Heat‑related issues (dehydration, overheating, cramps), especially in years like 2022.[^9][^4]
2. Nutrition failures over a 157‑mile day with nearly 8,000 ft of climbing; long day encourages riders to under‑fuel early.[^4]
3. Punctures/sidewall cuts from occasional sharper gravel, albeit overall surfaces are not considered highly technical.[^14][^12]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Not specifically documented, but any cutoffs are likely tied to later aids where riders slowed by heat fall off schedule; heat‑delayed riders at the dry aid in 2022 would be borderline if strict cutoffs were enforced.[^4]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Official Gravel Locos social media says: “you can ride just about any tire from a 700x35c to the biggest tire your gravel bike is rated for,” but emphasizes **puncture resistance and good sealant**.[^12]
- Reddit and TR threads converge on ~38–40 mm fast‑rolling gravel tires: Maxxis Rambler 38c SilkShield, Pirelli Cinturato Gravel H 40c, etc., optimized for hardpack and limestone.[^11][^8][^10]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Flats: multiple riders mention getting flats at Gravel Locos and using the event as a “redemption ride” after previous puncture issues.[^14]
- Occasional washboard and sharper gravel edges mean sealant and robust casings are important even though most of the course is smooth.[^12][^11][^10]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- With 7,800+ ft of vert over 150+ miles but nothing insanely steep (other than short punches like Loco Hill), most riders can get away with moderate gravel gearing (e.g., 1:1 or slightly below); training posts focus more on heat prep than super‑low gearing.[^9][^4]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- Better heat acclimation and hydration strategies, especially after the 2022 experience.[^9][^4]
- More puncture‑resistant tires and fresh sealant; Gravel Locos itself pushes this in their tire recommendation post.[^12]

Sources:[^14][^8][^11][^12][^10][^4]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Most flyers go through Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) and drive a few hours; Hico is described by riders as “the middle of nowhere,” but reachable via Dallas.[^15][^9]

**Lodging:**

- Many camp in or around Hico; Reddit users discuss camping in Glen Rose and note that Gravel Locos offers **boondocking options right on site**.[^15][^9]
- Others stay in Airbnbs or motels in nearby towns like Glen Rose or Stephenville, roughly 10–30 minutes away; cabins and small rentals near Hico cost similar to a chain hotel in Stephenville.[^9]

**Parking:**

- No notable complaints: town‑center event with plenty of space and a festival vibe; logistics issues that do crop up are about heat and water, not parking.[^3][^4]

**Packet pickup:**

- Not spelled out online in granular detail, but Gravel Locos markets a fun, community‑centric weekend, so expect pre‑race check‑in in town with local vendors and food.[^1][^3]

**Local tips:**

- Reddit locals emphasize the **small‑town vibe**, barbecue and Tex‑Mex options, and the novelty of seeing pro gravel racers descend on Hico.[^9][^4]
- One commenter: “The scenery in that part of Texas is filled with charming small-town vibes. It's at the northern edge of the Hill Country, featuring some steep climbs rather than mountain passes.”[^9]

## YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS

| Video | Channel | URL | Key Insight | Best Comments |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “Gravel Locos 2024 – Hico Tx” | YouTube (individual creator) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJYPrSFb6Tw [^2] | Describes Hico event as “such a fun and warm event” with 150, 100, 60, and 30 mile options; footage shows smooth Hill Country gravel, fast groups, and hot weather. [^2] | Comments echo that it looks like ideal Unbound prep with great community support. |
| Official \& team reels | Gravel Locos / teams on IG | Various (e.g., 2024 race result reel) [^16] | Short reels highlight pro front group, smooth roads, and festive finish in Hico; emphasize free 150‑mile flagship and charity aspect. [^16][^5] | Comments from riders thanking organizers and praising local hospitality. |

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Reddit thread calls 2023 “its third year running,” implying Hico Gravel Locos launched in 2021.[^4]

**Origin story:**

- Launched as a **charity‑focused, pro‑heavy but community‑driven** event in a cowboy town, with the flagship 150‑mile race offered for free and donations directed to Hico first responders and community causes.[^5][^3][^1]

**How it's evolved:**

- In just a few years it has become a major pro tune‑up for Unbound; Velo and CyclingNews cover it as a key warm‑up with international winners like Justine Barrow and Julien Gagne.[^7][^6]
- Organizers have expanded routes and field sizes while keeping the free‑150‑mile concept and strong local integration intact.[^5][^3]

**How community talks about it:**

- r/gravelcycling: “Go ride this race… I definitely intend to participate in Gravel Locos again in the future.”[^4]
- Locals: “I love the whole vibe of the Locos event… So yes, do this race. It is a lot of fun.”[^4]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Often paired with Unbound: many riders treat Gravel Locos La Loca as their last big race‑pace rehearsal; smooth but hilly Texas gravel vs Unbound’s rougher Kansas chunk and potential mud.[^6][^7][^4]
- Compared to mountain‑state epics, Gravel Locos is lower altitude and less technical, but heat and speed make it equally punishing if under‑prepared.[^9][^4]

- Heat acclimation: repeat warnings to train specifically in warm conditions and have a solid hydration/electrolyte plan, especially for Hico in late May.[^9][^4]
- Pacing and nutrition: focus on steady pacing across constant rollers and dialed fueling to avoid bonk/cramps late; successful riders report “no bonking or cramps” thanks to training nutrition.[^4]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Official per‑year DNF percentages or strict cutoff times.
- Fully detailed, annotated course notes (sector names, mile‑by‑mile hazards) beyond what riders report and the official GPX provides behind the scenes.

**Conflicting info:**

- Some reports list the 150 as “150 miles,” others note it’s actually ~157 miles; the official marketing leans to “150,” while rider computers show the longer figure.[^2][^1][^4]
