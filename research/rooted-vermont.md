## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Event PDF: “Cultivating a welcoming and celebratory gravel community… offering a physically challenging and Vermont‑centric race experience,” meaning heavy use of Vermont dirt and some Class IV roads.[^2]
- Reddit finisher: “83 miles of pristine gravel \& slippery singletrack in northern Vermont,” summarizing long‑route flavor as mostly pristine gravel with some spicy bits.[^4]

**Technical sections:**

- r/gravelcycling finisher: “There were a few miles of Class IV roads that were a bit gnarly, one short stretch of well‑built but very muddy single‑track behind a house that offered a rest stop, and the finish ran through a brief but very windy trail.”[^4]
- Same rider warns that in the wet year the singletrack and Class IV roads were “incredibly slick,” with real chances to go over the bars or down a slope to the river if you over‑cook it.[^4]

**Notable climbs:**

- Sip of Sunshine packs ~2,400 m climbing into ~140 km, so repeated 10–20% walls rather than one big pass; local comment: “The climbing in this area is extreme; 10‑20% grades are typical and most routes take only 5‑10 minutes. Climb as many routes as possible.”[^4]
- Short “Sip” route still has a “tough climb,” prompting a question whether it’s doable on mostly flat training; answer: yes, but expect punchy steeps.[^4]

**Problem areas:**

- Muddy singletrack behind the house rest stop and finish‑line trail in the rainy year are the biggest crash spots; finisher notes the possibility of going over the bars or down toward the river.[^4]
- Class IV sectors (unmaintained roads) get slick, rocky, and rooty in the wet, riding like 90s MTB per broader Vermont gravel commentary.[^3][^4]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2021 (wet year report) | r/gravelcycling thread: “By the time I arrived it had been pouring for about an hour, making everything incredibly slick.” Rain started around mile 70 for some riders; pros caught more. [^4] | Class IV and singletrack sectors became “slippery singletrack,” leading to cautious riding and a higher risk of going down slopes toward the river. [^4] |
| Typical summers | Vermont Sports: gravel riding in NEK \& central VT is mostly “fairly smooth dirt roads (after mud season!), though with some Class IV (unmaintained) roads. No single track. Lots of climbing though!” [^8][^3] | Rooted fits this—smooth dirt plus some rougher Class IV. Weather can switch quickly; late July/early Aug heat/humidity + afternoon storms common. [^8][^3] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Vermont midsummer: mornings often 50s–60s F, afternoons 70s–80s F with humidity; storms can drop temps quickly and turn clay/mud into slick mess.[^8][^3]

**Primary risk:**

- Rain‑induced mud on Class IV and singletrack, creating slick rock/roots and high crash risk, plus humidity‑driven dehydration on climbs.[^8][^3][^4]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Vermont hill country, not high altitude; the challenge is steep gradients and technical mud/roots rather than thin air.[^3][^8][^4]

## REDDIT DEEP DIVE

### r/gravelcycling threads:

**Thread:** “Rooted VT - 83 miles of pristine gravel \& slippery singletrack in northern Vermont.”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/oxb2jq/rooted_vt_83_miles_of_pristine_gravel_slippery/[^4]
**Key quotes:**

- “There were a few miles of Class IV roads that were a bit gnarly, one short stretch of well‑built but very muddy single‑track behind a house that offered a rest stop, and the finish ran through a brief but very windy trail. By the time I arrived it had been pouring for about an hour, making everything incredibly slick.” – u/recycledairplane1.[^4]
- “If it hadn’t been so wet it would have been fantastic. However, the chance to go over the bars or down the slope to the river at the farthest point of the ride made me exercise more caution there.” – same.[^4]
- “The climbing in this area is extreme; 10‑20% grades are typical and most routes take only 5‑10 minutes. Climb as many routes as possible.” – advice to someone training for the short Sip.[^4]
- “I was riding on Terreno Zeros tires, which have no tread—if I’d planned for the weather I’d have chosen a treaded option.” – tire regret in the mud.[^4]


### TrainerRoad \& others:

**Thread:** “Rooted Vermont Anyone?”
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/rooted-vermont-anyone/61531[^6]
**Key quotes:**

- “Rooted was today: what an amazing event! I'd highly recommend it to any of you northeast gravel racers/riders. Incredibly well-organized and Richmond is a fun town.” – TR user.[^6]

Other chatter folds Rooted into lists of NE gravel events (Muddy Onion, Vermont Overland, Rasputitsa, etc.) as a “must‑do” but not necessarily the gnarliest.[^9][^3]

## TRAINERROAD FORUM

- The TR “New England and New York events 2024” thread mentions Vermont Overland as more Class IV‑heavy (“90’s mountain biking”), while Rooted is talked about as challenging but more inclusive and less extreme than VO.[^9][^3][^6]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Section | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mid‑course Class IV roads | Unmaintained Vermont roads | “A few miles of Class IV roads that were a bit gnarly” become serious work when wet: rocks, ruts, roots, mud, and steep ramps; risk of crashes and walking. [^4][^3] |  |
| Muddy singletrack behind house | Short singletrack segment at rest stop | In wet year, became “very muddy single‑track behind a house”; slick enough that cautious riders worried about going over bars or down the slope to the river. [^4] |  |
| Finish‑line trail | Brief but windy trail at the end | Narrow, twisty, slick finish trail in the rain forces focus when riders are tired; easy to bin it right before the line. [^4] |  |
| Climbs throughout | 10–20% gradient punches | Short but steep climbs repeated all day; local advice warns that 10–20% grades are “typical,” so under‑prepared climbers suffer everywhere, not just one big hill. [^4] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- In that wet edition, the **muddy singletrack behind the house rest stop + windy finish trail** are what riders single out as the sketchiest, crash‑prone sectors.[^4]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No official numbers surfaced, but rainy‑year reports imply more crashes and caution, not mass DNFs, since distance (~140 km) is big but manageable and aid is good.[^6][^4]

**Most common reasons (inferred):**

1. Crashes or near‑crashes on muddy Class IV / singletrack sectors in wet years.[^4]
2. Underestimating Vermont’s short, steep climbing and blowing up on repeated 10–20% ramps.[^3][^8][^4]
3. Heat/humidity and hydration mistakes on a hilly course.[^8][^3]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Not clearly documented; likely back‑of‑pack riders delayed significantly by mud and walking on Class IV roads if extreme weather hits.[^2][^4]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Reddit finisher ran Vittoria Terreno Zero slicks and regretted them in the mud, saying they’d choose a treaded option if they’d known how wet it would be.[^4]
- Vermont Sports and NE gravel talk: Vermont dirt is mostly smooth but with Class IV sectors, so 38–42 mm gravel tires with some tread are common; in wet conditions, more aggressive tread is preferred.[^3][^8]
- 3T RaceMax “race‑winning at Rooted Vermont” article (3T): the winning RaceMax was run with aero‑optimized 700c gravel tires; while exact model isn’t spelled out in snippet, RaceMax support pages recommend up to 700×42 for events like Rooted.[^10][^11][^1]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Mud‑related drivetrain grind and chain suck on Class IV / singletrack when wet; finisher implies the bigger risk was traction and control, but muddy sectors inevitably eat drivetrains.[^8][^4]
- Potential sidewall cuts or rim strikes on rocky Class IV roads, although nothing like Santiam Wagon Road‑level carnage described.[^3][^8]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- With 2,400 m climbing over 140 km and many 10–20% ramps, New England riders encourage low gearing—sub‑1:1 for most amateurs; even strong riders can benefit from easy gears on short walls.[^12][^13][^4]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- Treaded tires instead of slicks when rain is in the forecast.[^4]
- More steep‑climb training: comment recommends climbing as many steep routes as possible before Rooted because of typical 10–20% grades.[^4]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Burlington International (BTV) is the main access; Richmond is a short drive southeast.[^2][^3]

**Lodging:**

- Richmond is small; many riders stay in/around Burlington, Richmond, or nearby towns and drive to the start, similar to other VT gravel events.[^2][^6][^3]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish in Richmond; TR user praises organization and town vibe, no parking horror stories recorded.[^6]

**Packet pickup:**

- Rooted is framed as a community weekend with events, talk sessions, and “water cooler chats”; packet pickup integrated with festival‑style activities.[^14][^7][^5]

**Local tips:**

- Vermont Sports and local groups describe the region as “gravel paradise” with lots of climbing and some Class IV; best prep is riding local NEK / central VT gravel to get used to gradients and surfaces.[^8][^3]

[^15] | Viewers comment that it looks like “Vermont gravel paradise” until the weather turns. |
| “Rooted Vermont Course: Spring emerging” | Rooted Vermont | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYBPxEQSt_E [^16] | Shows sections of course peeking through spring snow; Ted King: “we're going to have the full spectrum: buffed…,” hinting at variety of surfaces. [^16] | Emphasizes that course has both fast dirt and rougher bits. |
| “The race winning RaceMax from Rooted Vermont” | 3T | https://3t.bike/blogs/news/the-race-winning-racemax-from-rooted-vermont [^1] | Details a RaceMax setup that won Sip of Sunshine: ~140 km / 2,400 m course demands fast yet capable tires and race‑oriented aero gravel setup. [^1] | Highlights Rooted as proving ground for aero‑gravel setups with 40–42 mm tires. |

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Vermont Sports “Fresh Dirt” (2020) lists Rooted as part of the “new gravel rides” that appeared in the last 3 years, implying late‑2010s founding.[^3]

**Origin story:**

- Hosted by ex‑WorldTour pro Ted King and Laura King; Rooted aims to “cultivate a welcoming and celebratory gravel community” and “offer a physically challenging and Vermont‑centric race experience,” with storytelling and authenticity.[^5][^2]

**How it's evolved:**

- Built into a weekend festival with talks, group rides, and strong sponsor presence; course likely tweaked year‑to‑year for weather and land access but maintains mix of gravel + Class IV + short singletrack.[^14][^7][^5]

**How community talks about it:**

- TR: “Rooted was today: what an amazing event! I'd highly recommend it… Incredibly well-organized.”[^6]
- r/gravelcycling finisher describes it as “genuinely enjoyable” and notes that organizers “did a great job making it fun and inclusive for everyone” despite rough wet conditions.[^4]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to Vermont Overland, Rooted has less Class IV and is framed as more accessible while still very challenging; VO is called “fairly hardcore due to the amount of Class IV roads,” while Rooted uses them sparingly.[^9][^3]
- Compared to Western gravel, Rooted is shorter but steeper and more weather‑dependent, with more mud/roots potential and less altitude.[^8][^3][^4]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “There were a few miles of Class IV roads that were a bit gnarly, one short stretch of well‑built but very muddy single‑track behind a house that offered a rest stop, and the finish ran through a brief but very windy trail.” – u/recycledairplane1.[^4]
2. “By the time I arrived it had been pouring for about an hour, making everything incredibly slick.” – same.[^4]
3. “If it hadn’t been so wet it would have been fantastic. However, the chance to go over the bars or down the slope to the river at the farthest point of the ride made me exercise more caution there.” – same.[^4]
4. “I was riding on Terreno Zeros tires, which have no tread—if I’d planned for the weather I’d have chosen a treaded option.” – same.[^4]
5. “The climbing in this area is extreme; 10‑20% grades are typical and most routes take only 5‑10 minutes. Climb as many routes as possible.” – same, to a short‑course question.[^4]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “83 miles of pristine gravel \& slippery singletrack in northern Vermont.” – post title.[^4]
2. “VT truly feels like a gravel paradise.” – reply in same thread.[^4]
3. “Rooted was today: what an amazing event! I'd highly recommend it… Incredibly well-organized.” – TrainerRoad user.[^6]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do reports suggest for prep?

- Focus on short, steep climbs: practice repeated 5–10 minute efforts at 10–20% grades to mimic Vermont hills rather than long Alpine passes.[^3][^8][^4]
- Prepare for mud and slippery roots if forecast looks wet: choose treaded 38–42 mm tires and practice riding slick singletrack/Class IV at moderate speed.[^8][^4]
- Build technical comfort, but remember it’s still a gravel event: Rooted is less gnarly than Vermont Overland but has enough rough sectors that pure road skills may not be enough in the wet.[^9][^6][^3]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact current‑year distance/elevation for both Sip and Little Sip from the official site (older numbers ~140 km / 2,400 m are confirmed via 3T).[^1]
- Precise DNF percentages and official cutoff times.

**Conflicting info:**

- Location confusion: your prompt listed “East Burke,” but Rooted Vermont is headquartered in **Richmond**; East Burke is associated with other events and NEK riding weekends, not Rooted.[^2][^3][^8]
