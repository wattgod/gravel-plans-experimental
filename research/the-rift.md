# THE RIFT (HVOLSVÖLLUR, ICELAND) - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Generated: December 28, 2025

## OFFICIAL DATA

| Field | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Distance | Core distances: 200 km (“The Rift” main race), 140 km, 60 km; for 2026+ there is also a 330 km “Abyss” option. [^1][^2] | [^1][^2] |
| Elevation | 200 km course ~1,950 m climbing (GravGrav: 203 km, 1,950 m). [^3] | [^3] |
| Location | Starts/finishes in Hvolsvöllur, South Iceland, crossing the dark lava fields and highlands on the tectonic split between North America and Eurasia. [^1][^4] | [^1][^4] |
| Date (2025/2026) | Summer race (July); 2025/2026 dates listed on event site reg pages, typically mid‑July. [^1][^4] | [^1][^4] |
| Field size | International but capped field; GravGrav’s 2023 story describes large but manageable pelotons, not Unbound‑scale thousands. [^3] | [^3] |
| Entry cost | Premium European gravel pricing; tiered by distance; exact € amounts on registration page. [^1] | [^1] |
| Cutoff time | Time limits per distance (longest 200/330 km have strict all‑day cutoffs) due to remoteness and daylight; details in race manual. [^1] | [^1] |
| Aid stations | Multiple “service stations and river crossings” noted; main 200 km route has several feed/neutral points but long stretches truly remote. [^1][^3] | [^1][^3] |
| Registration type | Online, limited slots; sells out, especially 200 km and 330 km options. [^1][^2] | [^1][^2] |
| Website | https://www.therift.bike [^1] | [^1] |

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Official: 92% backcountry gravel roads on the 200 km course, through volcanic plains, lava fields, sand, and washboarded highland tracks; minimal pavement.[^1][^4]
- GravGrav: “203 km gravel race with 1950 m of elevation through the dark lava fields in the highlands of Iceland,” emphasizing chunks of chunky lava rock mixed with sand and fast sections.[^3]

**Technical sections:**

- Dómadalur washboards and lava plains: official description mentions “relentless washboards in Dómadalur” before a massive climb up Hekla’s roots.[^1]
- GravGrav: early pack riding where “the gravel often turns into sand from one second to the other and you are either fast enough to escape or you got sucked in and crashed and that happened multiple times to some riders next to me.”[^3]

**Notable climbs:**

- Big climb up the roots of Hekla volcano: course text calls it “a massive climb up the roots of Hekla volcano,” followed by plateau rolling terrain.[^1]
- Total vert (~1,950 m over 200 km) comes from these long, steady climbs rather than constant steep walls.[^3][^1]

**Problem areas:**

- Sand traps switching from firm to deep instantly: GravGrav reports multiple crashes when riders hit surprise sand pockets at speed in the front group.[^3]
- Washboards + chunky lava rock on exposed highlands are punishing for hands, bikes, and speeds; official text notes “chunky lava rocks, sand, and washboarded backcountry roads with multiple river crossings that often require dismounting.”[^1]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2023 | GravGrav: cold, windy, and variable; clouds and sun; “unpredictable Icelandic weather” but 203 km/1,950 m loop completed. [^3] | Riders dealt with wind and temp swings; sand and crashes more notable than rain. [^3] |
| Typical years | Official: Icelandic highlands described as “vast, rugged and unpredictable… a challenge of endurance, mental fortitude and bare elements,” implying wind, rain, and quick temperature changes. [^4] | Emphasis on preparing for cold rain and strong wind even in mid‑summer. [^1][^4] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Highland summer: can range from single‑digit Celsius (40s F) with wind/rain to mild summer temps under sun; large swings in a single day.[^4][^1]

**Primary risk:**

- Exposure: cold wind, potential rain, and long remote stretches with river crossings where hypothermia is possible if gear is inadequate.[^4][^1][^3]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Not extreme altitude (Iceland highlands vs Colorado), but enough upland exposure that weather, not thin air, is the main issue.[^4][^1]

Sources:[^1][^4][^3]

## REDDIT / FORUM DEEP DIVE

- Detailed first‑person tech commentary shows up more in blogs/Facebook than Reddit; a 2025 FB post from a rider describes 2022 route including gravel, lava fields, river crossings, and even snow fields.[^5]

Key FB quotes:

- “The first was The Rift, Iceland's first gravel race, a 125 mile race ... The 2022 route took in gravel, lava fields, river crossings, snow fields …” – rider summarizing terrain variety.[^5]


## TRAINERROAD / OTHER FORUMS

- No rich TrainerRoad thread; The Rift is discussed in bucket‑list lists alongside Unbound, Migration, etc., with emphasis on scenery, remoteness, and weather rather than pure distance.[^2][^3]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| km | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Early race | Fast lava‑field pack section | Gravel transitions to sand “from one second to the other,” causing multiple crashes as riders get “sucked in” when not fast enough to surf out. [^3] |  |
| Mid‑race | Dómadalur washboards | “Relentless washboards in Dómadalur” beat up hands and bikes before the big Hekla climb. [^1] |  |
| Big climb | Hekla volcano climb | Long sustained climb off washboards into high plateau; wind and exposure plus fatigue make this the mental breaking point. [^1][^3] |  |
| Late | River crossings + high plateau | Multiple river crossings often requiring dismounting; cold water and wind late in the day can crack under‑dressed riders. [^1][^5] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- The combination of **sand pockets that suddenly appear at speed** and the **Hekla climb after Dómadalur washboards** is the defining brutality: crashes early, attrition later.[^3][^1]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No simple % published, but description of multiple crashes in front pack and harsh elements plus long distance suggests notable attrition, especially in 200 km.[^5][^1][^3]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Crashes from surprise sand transitions and rough lava gravel at race pace.[^3]
2. Exposure/hypothermia from wind, rain, and cold river crossings in insufficient clothing.[^4][^1]
3. Mechanical failures: flats and damage from chunky lava rock + washboards over 200+ km.[^1][^3]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Likely mid‑to‑late in the 200 km and especially 330 km distances, on the high plateau after Hekla and before the descent back to Hvolsvöllur if conditions slow the field.[^2][^1]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- GravGrav: notes that when gravel turns into sand “from one second to the other,” riders either carry speed or get sucked in, implying benefit from wider, higher‑volume gravel tires to stay afloat.[^3]
- Official course describes “chunky lava rocks, sand, and washboarded roads,” pointing toward robust 40–45 mm+ gravel tires with durable casings, not minimal 35s.[^1]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Crashes and flats from hitting deep sand or volcanic rocks at speed; GravGrav explicitly mentions crashes next to the author.[^3]
- Long washboard sections can loosen bolts and punish rims/spokes/drivetrains.[^5][^1]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- With ~1,950 m over 200 km and long climbs, most riders favor low gearing (sub‑1:1) to climb seated into wind rather than mashing; this is more reported in general Iceland gravel advice than a single quote, but implied by course profile.[^1][^3]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More volume and robustness to cope with sand + lava rock at speed.[^3]
- Better weather gear: multiple sources stress preparing for wind, rain, and cold river crossings even if the start looks benign.[^5][^4][^1]

Sources:[^2][^4][^5][^1][^3]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Keflavík International (KEF); riders then typically drive or shuttle to Hvolsvöllur (South Coast).[^1]

**Lodging:**

- Hvolsvöllur and nearby South Coast towns provide lodging; high demand around race weekend, so early booking recommended.[^1]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish in Hvolsvöllur; small‑town logistics, parking around event HQ and local lots; no major complaints surfaced.[^1]

**Packet pickup:**

- Done in Hvolsvöllur with race briefing covering weather, river crossings, and mandatory gear.[^1]

**Local tips:**

- Organizers emphasize being self‑sufficient between aid stations and taking weather warnings seriously; this is more mini‑expedition than typical US farm‑road gravel.[^4][^1]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Promoted as “Iceland’s first gravel race”; early editions pre‑2020, now established as marquee European ultra‑gravel event.[^5][^4]

**Origin story:**

- Designed to showcase the highlands and the tectonic rift between continents; marketed as a “gravel battle between the continents” with ever‑shifting battlefield.[^4]

**How it's evolved:**

- Distance menu expanded from 200 km and shorter to include a 330 km “Abyss” by 2026, plus 60 km and 140 km options (“Crack” and “Crevasse”).[^2]
- Course refined into “new course” description but still centered on Hvolsvöllur–lava‑fields–Hekla–plateau loop.[^4][^1]

**How community talks about it:**

- Framed as a unique combo of volcanic landscapes, river crossings, and harsh weather rather than pure distance; often cited as bucket‑list for gravel travelers.[^2][^3]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to Unbound: less vert but more extreme environment (lava, rivers, wind, cold) and more remote; sand traps play a similar race‑splitting role as Flint Hills rock sectors.[^6][^7][^3]
- Compared to Migration or Oregon Trail: similar “expedition” vibe but with harsher weather and less altitude, more focus on elements and surface weirdness.[^4][^3][^1]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “The gravel often turns into sand from one second to the other… either fast enough to escape or you got sucked in and crashed.” – GravGrav.[^3]
2. “The Rift is a gravel race through the dark lava fields in the highlands of Iceland – taking place on the tectonic split between North America and Eurasia.” – official.[^4]
3. “A long, wild, and demanding highland expedition.” – 200 km course description.[^1]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do reports suggest for prep?

- Practice riding loose sand transitions at speed and holding lines on washboards and chunky gravel; early pack crashes show how crucial handling is.[^3]
- Build resilience to cold/wet/windy conditions with appropriate clothing systems and mental prep; this is as much about elements as fitness.[^4][^1]
- Train steady climbing and long tempo on rough surfaces rather than huge steep walls; ~1,950 m over 200 km is about staying on gas all day.[^3][^1]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact per‑year DNF stats and breakdowns by cause.
- Detailed waypointed hazard list (exact km of each river crossing, etc.) beyond the general course descriptions.

**Conflicting info:**

- Distance and vert: GravGrav cites 203 km / 1,950 m; official shorthand is 200 km; 2022 FB post calls it 125 miles—minor route/year variations but same ballpark.[^5][^3][^1]
