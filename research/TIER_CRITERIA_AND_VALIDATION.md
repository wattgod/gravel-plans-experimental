# Gravel God Tier Criteria & Validation Guide

## Overview
The Gravel God rating system uses 14 variables to assess gravel races, but **TIER IS PRIMARILY ABOUT PRESTIGE**, not just course difficulty math. A smooth, fast race can be Tier 1 if it has major prestige, while a brutally hard race can be Tier 3 if nobody knows about it.

## The 14-Variable System

### Course Profile (7 variables, max 35 points)
| Variable | Description | Scale |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Length | Distance of flagship course | 1-5 (1=short, 5=ultra) |
| Technicality | Technical difficulty of terrain | 1-5 (1=smooth, 5=MTB-level) |
| Elevation | Total climbing | 1-5 (1=flat, 5=mountain) |
| Climate | Weather challenge factor | 1-5 (1=mild, 5=brutal) |
| Altitude | High altitude impact | 1-5 (1=sea level, 5=10,000ft+) |
| Adventure | Remoteness/wilderness factor | 1-5 (1=suburban, 5=wilderness) |
| Logistics | Ease of travel/lodging | 1-5 (1=hard, 5=easy) |

### Editorial/Biased Opinion (7 variables, max 35 points)
| Variable | Description | Scale |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Prestige | Industry/media recognition | 1-5 (1=unknown, 5=iconic) |
| Race Quality | Organization quality | 1-5 (1=poor, 5=professional) |
| Experience | Memorable race experience | 1-5 (1=forgettable, 5=legendary) |
| Community | Community/culture strength | 1-5 (1=impersonal, 5=family) |
| Field Depth | Pro field strength | 1-5 (1=local, 5=international) |
| Value | Bang for buck | 1-5 (1=overpriced, 5=great value) |
| Expenses | Overall cost to attend | 1-5 (1=expensive, 5=affordable) |

## Score Calculation
```
Course Profile = sum of 7 course variables (max 35)
Editorial = sum of 7 editorial variables (max 35)
Total = Course + Editorial (max 70)
Overall Score = (Total / 70) × 100
```

## Tier Thresholds
| Tier | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | 85-100 | Premier events - bucket list races with major prestige |
| **Tier 2** | 75-84 | Major events - well-known, solid execution |
| **Tier 3** | <75 | Regional/niche events - local favorites or growing races |

## CRITICAL: Prestige Override

**The math is a guide, but TIER is ultimately about PRESTIGE in the gravel world.**

### Tier 1 Criteria (must meet MOST of these):
- $40,000+ prize purse
- 2,000+ riders
- Lifetime Grand Prix or equivalent series inclusion
- Major media coverage (Velo, CyclingNews, VeloNews)
- International pro field (Keegan Swenson, Lauren De Crescenzo, etc.)
- Cultural significance (Bobby hugs, belt buckles, champagne gravel branding)
- Sells out quickly / lottery system

### Tier 1 Races (as of 2025):
- **Unbound Gravel 200** - THE gravel race, $100K+ purse, 4,000 riders
- **Mid-South** - $100K purse, Bobby hugs, cultural icon
- **SBT GRVL** - Champagne gravel, major pro field
- **Belgian Waffle Ride** - $50K purse, Quad-Tripel Crown series
- **Barry-Roubaix** - World's Largest Gravel Race, 5,300 riders
- **Big Sugar** - Bentonville cycling destination, major event
- **Gravel Worlds** - $100K purse, OG grassroots
- **Rebecca's Private Idaho** - $50K Queen's Stage, Rebecca Rusch
- **Dirty Reiver** - UK's premier gravel race, 2,000 riders
- **Leadville Trail 100 MTB** - Lifetime Grand Prix, belt buckle culture
- **Traka 360** - 4,000+ riders, Europe's largest
- **Sea Otter Gravel** - Lifetime Grand Prix (as of 2025)
- **Crusher in the Tushar** - Lifetime Grand Prix

### Tier 2 Races (solid but not premier):
- The Rad (was LGP in 2024, not in 2025. Trinidad, CO climbing race)
- BWR Cedar City (smaller than CA event)
- Oregon Trail Gravel (5-day stage race, 200 riders)
- Gravel Locos (FREE but regional)
- Ned Gravel (local favorite)
- Rooted Vermont (Ted King, but smaller)
- The Rift (Iceland, 1,000 riders)
- Migration Gravel Race (epic but tiny field, expensive)

### Tier 3 Races (regional/niche):
- Big Horn Gravel (hard but unknown)

## Validation Checklist

Before assigning a tier, verify:

1. **Check prize purse** - $40K+ usually = Tier 1
2. **Check field size** - 2,000+ usually = Tier 1
3. **Check series inclusion** - Lifetime Grand Prix = Tier 1 consideration
4. **Check media coverage** - Major press = Tier 1 consideration
5. **Check cultural significance** - Iconic moments/traditions = Tier 1
6. **Verify the math** - Run the 14-variable calculation
7. **Apply prestige override** - Adjust tier if prestige warrants it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't let course difficulty alone determine tier** - A brutal course with no prestige is Tier 3
2. **Don't inflate scores to force a tier** - Let the math guide, then apply prestige judgment
3. **Don't copy fabricated data** - Always verify with research
4. **Don't assume all Lifetime races are Tier 1** - Some are Tier 2 (Crusher)

## Research Sources
All tier assignments should be backed by Perplexity research files in `/research/`. If no research exists, the data may be fabricated and needs validation.
