# NED GRAVEL (NEDERLAND, CO) - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Generated: December 28, 2025

## OFFICIAL DATA

| Field | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Distance | Four courses: Tungsten (hardest), Gold (~50 mi, 5,900 ft), Silver (~20 mi, 2,200 ft), Bronze (10 mi, 1,000 ft). [^1][^2] | [^1][^2] |
| Elevation | Gold: 5,900 ft climbing over 50 mi; Silver: ~2,200 ft over ~20 mi; Bronze: 1,000 ft over 10 mi. [^1][^2][^3] | [^1][^2][^3] |
| Location | Nederland, Colorado, ~17 miles west of Boulder along the Peak to Peak Highway, around 8,200 ft elevation. [^1][^4][^5] | [^1][^4][^5] |
| Date (2025/2026) | July 12, 2025 race day; typically mid‑July each year. [^1][^6] | [^1][^6] |
| Field size | Growing Front Range event; press and Bicycle Colorado call it “one of the premier Colorado gravel events” with strong local and regional turnout. [^4][^7][^5] | [^4][^7][^5] |
| Entry cost | BikeReg lists tiered pricing; registration opens first for women, BIPOC, non‑binary, and paracyclists, then general public a week later (inclusive model). [^6] | [^6] |
| Cutoff time | Not explicitly posted on public site; distances and vert suggest generous but real cutoffs in the athlete guide. [^1][^2] | [^1][^2] |
| Aid stations | Multiple aid stations per longer course: Gold and Tungsten hit Gold Hill, Switzerland/Wallstreet area, and the shared “103 aid station” on Peak to Peak; Silver and Bronze hit fewer. [^2] | [^2] |
| Registration type | Online via BikeReg with priority windows for under‑represented groups and code‑of‑conduct acceptance. [^1][^6][^8] | [^1][^6][^8] |

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Official race info: every course mixes pavement, steep climbs, and “well maintained gravel roads,” with the climbs to “challenge you,” descents to “make you smile,” and views to “take your breath away.”[^2]
- Gold and Tungsten explicitly include Switzerland Trail, an old railroad grade that is “sandy and bumpy but not too technical,” plus rougher sections like Rowena Trail and Sawmill/Gold Run.[^2]

**Technical sections:**

- Switzerland Trail: described as a mellow 2–6% railroad‑grade climb/descend that is “sandy and bumpy but not too technical,” but riders still call it “quite tough” and “more appropriate for a full suspension bike” in practice.[^3][^2]
- Rowena Trail on Tungsten: accessed via Lefthand Canyon; it is a rough, steep dirt/jeep section that feels much closer to XC MTB than smooth gravel.[^2]

**Notable climbs:**

- Gold Course: 50 mi / 5,900 ft, with repeated climbs—Peak to Peak roller, Gold Hill Rd, Switzerland Trail railroad‑grade climb, CR126 final climb.[^3][^2]
- Tungsten: adds Sugarloaf Mountain Rd (steep paved pitch ~17% at one point) and extra Switzerland/Rowena loops; Ned’s site highlights that “the steepest pitch of the course (17%!)” is on this segment.[^2]

**Problem areas:**

- A Facebook review of the “20 mile” (Silver/Bronze‑ish) ride calls it “a tough ride for only 20 miles” with a “2.5 mile stretch at an average” steep grade (the snippet truncates the exact number, but implies sustained steepness).[^9]
- 2021–2024 safety coverage in Velo notes an incident on Gold Hill Rd where riders impeded emergency responders, showing that Gold Hill’s steep, rough dirt plus race traffic can become chaotic.[^8]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Typical high‑country July: cool mornings, strong sun mid‑day, potential thunderstorms; no widely reported weather disaster, but Velo focused on a crash/response issue, not weather. [^8][^4] | Race “declared resounding success” in local coverage; difficulty narrative is about altitude and tech, not storms. [^7][^5] |
| 2023 | Distancetoempty 2022 report + rider comments suggest dry/dusty conditions with hot sun and afternoon clouds; no big mud year reported. [^10] | Climbing/technical descents, not weather, were main pain points. [^10] |
| 2022 | Distance to Empty: “climbs were extra spicy and the descents were just as tough,” but no mention of weather extremes, implying standard Colorado summer: crisp morning, warm/dry afternoon. [^10] | Course rode fast but rough; high‑altitude sun and dehydration still real risks. [^10] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Nederland in mid‑July: around 40s–50s F at start, 70s–80s F by afternoon in the sun, with big UV and fast weather shifts.[^4][^11]

**Primary risk:**

- Altitude (8,200+ ft) plus steep climbing and rough descents; typical Colorado thunderstorm threat exists but hasn’t dominated recent narratives.[^10][^5][^4]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Start around 8,200 ft in Nederland; high points on Gold Hill/Switzerland/Sugarloaf sectors approach or exceed 9,000 ft.[^5][^4][^2]

## REDDIT DEEP DIVE

### r/gravelcycling threads:

**Thread:** “Ned Gravel race done, slowly”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1lz71qr/ned_gravel_race_done_slowly/[^3]
**Key quotes:**

- “I just completed the Ned Gravel Gold course, which is a challenging 50 miles with an elevation gain of 5900 feet.” – u/Pyrosticks.[^3]
- “Overall, the race was enjoyable, although I found the Switzerland trail to be quite tough. It's definitely more appropriate for a full suspension bike.” – same.[^3]

**Thread:** “If You're Riding Ned Gravel in Nederland, CO this July, You …”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/nw4de2/if_youre_riding_ned_gravel_in_nederland_co_this/[^12]
**Key quotes:**

- “The entire ride looks amazing. The climbs would kill me but I'd have such an amazing feeling finishing a ride like that.” – commenter, reacting to course map and vert.[^12]
- Thread reinforces that Ned is perceived as a legit high‑altitude, high‑climbing event, not a gentle gravel social.[^12]

**Tire/width chatter referencing Ned:**

- In a general tire‑size thread, one rider says they’re running 47 mm Ramblers and plan to race Ned Gravel, SBT, and BWR Utah on them, implying Ned benefits from wide, MTB‑ish gravel tires.[^13]


### r/boulder \& local threads:

**Thread:** “Best bike/setup for navigating Boulder's mix of asphalt and gravel?”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1czx314/best_bikesetup_for_navigating_boulders_mix_of/[^14]
**Key quote:**

- “Bikes labeled as ‘gravel’ are a good choice, but really anything that can fit a larger tire (no less than 35mm, 43 or 47 even better).” – local advice that applies directly to Ned’s chunky mountain gravel.[^14]


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

- No dedicated Ned Gravel thread surfaced; chatter shows up more in general tire and race‑planning discussions where Ned is grouped with SBT and BWR as a “big day” goal.[^13]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~0–10 (all but Bronze) | Early climb out of Nederland on Peak to Peak \& Ridge/Cold Springs | For low‑landers, immediate climbing at ~8,200 ft spikes HR; Silver rider review of 20 mi course calls it “a tough ride for only 20 miles” with a 2.5‑mile steep stretch. [^9][^2] |  |
| Mid‑Gold/Tungsten | Gold Hill Rd + Gold Run / Sawmill | “Steep climbs and fast downhills” on rough dirt; combination of gradient and chunk is where middle‑pack riders start to crack. [^2][^7] |  |
| Switzerland Trail (North \& South) | Long sandy/bumpy RR grade | Gold‑course finisher calls Switzerland “quite tough” and “more appropriate for a full suspension bike,” especially late in the day when hands and back are cooked. [^2][^3] |  |
| Rowena + CR126 final climb (Tungsten/Gold) | Rough trail + last big climb | Rowena adds roughness; final CR126 climb after the fast descent from 103 aid station breaks under‑fueled riders before the last 3‑mile downhill to finish. [^2] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- **Switzerland Trail** is the recurring talking point: officially described as “bumpy but not too technical,” but rider reports describe it as the section that feels like you should be on a full‑suspension MTB, particularly on the Gold course.[^2][^3]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No published percentages, but local press and Bicycle Colorado still describe Ned as “one of the highest, most inclusive, and most challenging” Colorado gravel events; altitude, vert, and technical-ish segments imply meaningful attrition, especially on Tungsten and Gold.[^4][^7][^5]

**Most common reasons (inferred from reports):**

1. Altitude and climbing load: 50 mi with 5,900 ft at 8,200+ ft base altitude is a big ask for sea‑level riders, leading to pacing errors and blow‑ups.[^10][^5][^3]
2. Technical fatigue on Switzerland/Rowena/Gold Hill descents: over‑biked riders may be fine, but many gravel setups get rattled into mistakes and minor crashes.[^10][^2][^3]
3. Mechanical issues on rough trails (pinch flats, dinged rims) and brake fade on long dirt descents.[^7][^10][^2]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Not clearly documented, but any time limits would likely bite on Gold/Tungsten after the Switzerland/Rowena sectors and before the last climb back towards Nederland.[^4][^2]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Ned Gravel itself markets the Gold course as “more gravel bike friendly” after 2023 redesign “removing the most technical sections,” but it still retains Switzerland, sandy/bumpy RR grade, and some rough descents.[^2]
- A general tire‑size thread mentions using 47 mm Ramblers for Ned, SBT, and BWR Utah, indicating that larger 43–47 mm gravel tires are common choices for Ned’s chunky terrain.[^13]
- Local Boulder advice: “no less than 35mm, 43 or 47 even better” for mixed asphalt/gravel routes of this type.[^14]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Reports emphasize bumpy Switzerland and steep descents; while specific flat/crash stats aren’t widely published, the course has enough chunk and speed to justify robust casings and careful pressure.[^10][^3][^2]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- With 5,900 ft over 50 mi (Gold) and even more on Tungsten, plus pitches to 17% on Sugarloaf, riders lean towards proper low gearing (sub‑1:1) rather than “racy” gravel gears, particularly at altitude.[^3][^2]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- A full‑suspension bike or at least more volume/comfort: “Switzerland trail… definitely more appropriate for a full suspension bike.”[^3]
- More climbing‑specific prep; the “done, slowly” Gold finisher admits 35–40 mi with 4,000 ft would have been more realistic given their fitness.[^3]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Denver International (DEN) is the standard; Nederland is roughly 1.5 hours’ drive via Boulder and Boulder Canyon / Peak to Peak.[^5][^4]

**Lodging:**

- Nederland is small; many racers stay in Nederland, Boulder, or along the Peak to Peak corridor, with additional options in nearby mountain towns and camping in the area.[^7][^5][^4]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish at Guercio Field in Nederland; community‑scale event with on‑site parking and small‑town street closures, no major parking complaints noted.[^1][^4][^2]

**Packet pickup:**

- Race info highlights monthly group rides and local build‑up; packet pickup and pre‑race events occur in town (details in yearly athlete email/guide).[^11][^1]

**Local tips:**

- Bicycle Colorado describes Ned Gravel as a “showcase for what the Front Range mountains have to offer,” emphasizing altitude and mixed surfaces.[^4]
- Local press and organizers stress inclusivity and a strong code of conduct after a 2024 safety incident involving emergency responders on Gold Hill Road.[^15][^8][^7]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- First edition in 2021; press coverage that year framed it as a new, high‑altitude, inclusive event on the Peak to Peak corridor.[^5][^7]

**Origin story:**

- Founded to build “one of the most challenging and inclusive gravel races in the world in the mountains surrounding Colorado's Peak to Peak Hwy,” with equal prize purse and priority reg for women/BIPOC/non‑binary riders.[^6][^1][^15][^5]

**How it's evolved:**

- 2023 redesign of Gold course “removed the most technical sections to make it more gravel bike friendly,” but organizers still intentionally include sections like Switzerland and Rowena to keep it gritty.[^2]
- Safety incident on Gold Hill Rd in 2024 led to new rider code‑of‑conduct requirements (stop for emergency vehicles, follow rules of the road) starting the following year.[^8]

**How community talks about it:**

- Bicycle Colorado: “one of the premier Colorado gravel events and a showcase for what the Front Range mountains have to offer.”[^4]
- Gravel Cyclist and local Mountain‑Ear emphasize “highest, most inclusive, and most challenging” branding; riders echo that it’s legit hard but beautiful.[^7][^5]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to lower‑altitude events like Gravel Locos, Ned is shorter in miles but similar or higher in vert density and far more altitude‑affected.[^10][^4]
- In the Colorado ecosystem it sits between very technical MTB and smoother gravel (e.g., SBT), with enough chunk that some riders prefer hardtails or wide 45–47 mm gravel tires.[^13][^10][^3]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “I just completed the Ned Gravel Gold course, which is a challenging 50 miles with an elevation gain of 5900 feet. To be honest, I wasn't fully prepared for it. A distance of 35 or 40 miles with around 4000 feet of climbing would have been more manageable for me that day.” – u/Pyrosticks.[^3]
2. “Overall, the race was enjoyable, although I found the Switzerland trail to be quite tough. It's definitely more appropriate for a full suspension bike.” – u/Pyrosticks.[^3]
3. “Ned Gravel was everything it promised to be and more! The climbs were extra spicy and the descents were just as tough.” – Distance to Empty.[^10]
4. “Based in Nederland, Colorado, just 17 miles west of Boulder, Ned Gravel solidified its position to be one of the highest, most inclusive, and most challenging gravel events in the world.” – press release.[^5][^7]
5. “We are building one of the most challenging and inclusive gravel races in the world in the mountains surrounding Colorado's Peak to Peak Hwy. Everyone join us.” – NedGravel Facebook.[^15]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “The climbs would kill me but I'd have such an amazing feeling finishing a ride like that.” – r/gravelcycling comment.[^12]
2. “The climbs were extra spicy and the descents were just as tough.” – Distance to Empty.[^10]
3. “It's definitely more appropriate for a full suspension bike.” – Gold finisher on Switzerland Trail.[^3]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do reports suggest for prep?

- Prioritize sustained climbing at altitude: 50 mi / 5,900 ft (Gold) and more for Tungsten demand real climbing legs rather than just flat endurance.[^5][^10][^3]
- Practice handling on rocky, sandy railroad grades (Switzerland) and rough jeep roads (Rowena/Gold Hill) on your race setup, whether that’s a chunky gravel bike or light MTB.[^10][^2][^3]
- Build heat and sun tolerance for high‑UV July days at 8,200+ ft, and dial in hydration/electrolytes—altitude dehydration creeps up fast.[^11][^4][^5]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Detailed year‑by‑year DNF stats, cutoff times, and exact incident counts for crashes/mechanicals.
- Full Tungsten course GPX stats in text form (miles/vert) beyond marketing descriptions and maps.

**Conflicting info:**

- Gold course stats differ slightly between official text (50 mi / 5,900 ft) and one solo Gold‑course ride report (38 mi / 3,875 ft), likely due to earlier‑year version vs current full race route.[^16][^2]
