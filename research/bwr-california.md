## TERRAIN & TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY

**Overall Character:**
- "Punishing gravel race"
- Mixed-surface technical challenge
- 30-40% off-road percentage (highest among Tier 1 races)
- Not pure gravel - hybrid terrain race

**Surface Breakdown:**
- 60-70% paved roads/sections
- 30-40% unpaved: gravel + singletrack + sand + rock gardens
- Water crossings documented
- Curbs and berms in course

**Technical Sections:**
- "Hell Hole" - exact location unclear, known technical crux
- Single-track mandatory (must have MTB skills)
- Technical descents with 90° turns
- Rock gardens documented
- Washed-out dirt sections

**Crash Profile:**
- Crashes extremely common
- "Increasing part of gravel racing at speed"
- "Lots of wounds and bandages at finish" reported
- Single-track increases crash risk
- Road surface transitions dangerous at speed

**Skills Required:**
- MTB (mountain bike) experience STRONGLY recommended
- "Single-track lessons recommended" for road racers
- Bike handling paramount
- Descending confidence essential

## EQUIPMENT & PRO SETUPS

### Tire Strategy:
- Pro consensus: Full slick tires (Maxxis Reaver 40mm)
- Tire pressure: 31-32 PSI start
- Logic: Hard-pack, road sections favor rolling speed
- Strategy: "Party in front, business in back" - fast wheel up front, durable rear
- Width: 40mm standard

### Bike Choice:
- Standard gravel bikes capable of singletrack
- No suspension mentioned (rigid forks)
- Components matter (durability for rocks)

### Historical Equipment Issues:
- Payson McElveen: Punctured 7 miles from finish (2024)
- Water bottle ejection documented
- Tire pressure decision critical

## WEATHER & CONDITIONS

### April 2025 (San Diego Area):
- Typically mild, 65-75°F
- Low rain probability in April
- Occasional Santa Ana winds possible
- Cool mornings, warm afternoons
- Coastal proximity influence

## RACE CHARACTER & PHILOSOPHY

### Belgian Influence (Michael Marckx):
- "Belgian-inspired philosophy"
- Named after Belgian cycling tradition
- Emphasis on toughness, uncompromising race design
- Non-UCI sanctioned (allows more creative course design)

### Quad-Tripel Crown Series:
- Four distinct races (CA, AZ, UT, MT)
- Each location brings unique terrain
- Attracts elite gravel racers
- Professional level + amateur categories

### 3-Day Festival Format:
- Friday: Expo
- Saturday: Gran fondo (non-competitive)
- Sunday: Official race (timed, competitive)
- Community atmosphere

### Charitable:
- San Diego Curebound (cancer research beneficiary)
- Fundraising component built in

## 2025 VENUE RELOCATION

**What Changed:**
- Traditional SoCal route moved to Del Mar Polo Fields
- Reason: Likely permit/land access issues
- First-time racers have no local precedent
- Unknown how terrain change affects difficulty
