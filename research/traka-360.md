# THE TRAKA 360 (GIRONA, SPAIN) - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Generated: December 28, 2025

## OFFICIAL DATA

| Field | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Distance | 360 km flagship distance (2024 RWGPS shows 358.1 km). Other events: 200, 100, 50 km, plus 560 km “Adventure”/Traka Adventure distance. [^1][^2][^3][^4] |  |
| Elevation | 360 km: ~2,900–3,700 m gain depending on year (RWGPS 2024 route: 2,921 m; Gravel Earth/Traka 2025 release: “360 kilometers with 3,700 meters of elevation gain”). [^2][^4] |  |
| Location | Girona, Catalonia (Spain); loops through Gavarres, Les Guilleries, coast near Calella/L’Escala, and inland hills on mostly gravel tracks and farm roads. [^5][^6][^3] |  |
| Date (2024/2025) | Early May “Traka week”; 2024 race streamed live May 2; 2025 360 ran first weekend of May. [^7][^4] |  |
| Field size | One of Europe’s largest gravel events; described as “Europe’s biggest gravel race” with stacked 360/200 fields and “who’s who” of gravel. [^1][^3][^8][^4] |  |
| Entry cost | Premium European gravel pricing; tiered by distance and reg date via thetraka.com. [^3][^4] |  |
| Cutoff time | 360 km has strict time limits (18–20 h range) with early‑morning start (often 6:00). Live stream shows many riding deep into night. [^9][^7][^4] |  |
| Aid stations | Multiple feed zones; Ben Turner/VOOM and others describe several staffed stops plus resupply from towns. [^10][^9] |  |
| Registration type | Online via The Traka; part of Gravel Earth Series calendar. [^11][^12][^4] |  |
| Website | Event pages referenced via gravel earth and media; RWGPS 2024 route is titled “THE TRAKA 360 – 2024.” [^2][^12][^4] |  |

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Laka ride review: “The terrain is 85% gravel! The 360 course is kind of made up in sections. So the first part was nice flowing terrain outside of Girona before a more rolling section and then some rougher stuff.”[^6]
- CyclingWeekly: 360 km ride “around Girona” with rough sections that “were questionably rough and better suited to a mountain bike.”[^5]

**Technical sections:**

- CyclingWeekly: “some sections being questionably rough and better suited to a mountain bike,” prompting the rider to run 50 mm tires with tubeless.[^5]
- BikeRadar tech gallery notes local Girona tire choice trending to 40–45 mm with real tread for the 200/360 because of rough descents and rocky farm tracks.[^13]

**Notable climbs:**

- RWGPS 2024: 2,921 m over 358 km implies many medium‑length climbs rather than monster passes, but VOOM report highlights named features like “Garmin Hill – the steepest, slowest, most brutal climb of the day.”[^2][^9]
- VOOM: “Right on cue came Garmin Hill. The steepest, slowest, most brutal climb of the day… Then came one more climb, the long flat roll home.”[^9]

**Problem areas:**

- VOOM: “Garmin Hill” late in the day when legs are cooked; described as the hardest pitch after already 300+ km.[^9]
- BIKEPACKING.com’s Traka Adventure piece describes 560 km variant getting “rough pretty quickly,” with riders quitting before first pass due to steepness and ruggedness; while that’s the longer distance, it shares organizers and style—steep, rugged, potentially overgrown tracks.[^3]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | RAW Cycling/YouTube “The Traka 2024 – the unexpected ride”: forecast forcing major course changes on 560 km due to snow in mountains; 360 stayed in lower terrain. [^14][^15] | BIKEPACKING: 560 km route recut below snowline, removing ~30% of elevation but leaving “extended flooded farm tracks… water often as high as half our wheels,” making progress “an absolute slog.” [^3] |
| 2023 | Laka and CW: dry, dusty conditions with hot afternoon sun; early sections “a dream. Dry gravel, golden light, cool morning air,” later becoming a long hot day. [^5][^6] | CW finished 360 having learned “never too much cushion” due to roughness and length. [^5] |
| Typical | VOOM 2025: 6 am start with “crisp air, dry gravel, bliss” turning into a long hot day; 360 riders finish in heat and darkness. [^10][^9] | Traka is positioned as a hot, dusty spring race, but mountain variants have had snow/rain issues. [^14][^3][^4] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Pre‑dawn start ~single‑digit Celsius; mid‑day in Catalonia can be 20–25°C+ with sun, making 12–18 h efforts hot and dehydrating.[^4][^10][^5][^9]

**Primary risk:**

- Heat, dehydration, and accumulated fatigue over 360 km; in wet/variant years, flooding and mud on farm tracks.[^10][^3][^5][^9]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Girona is near sea level; 360 course climbs into hills but not high‑mountain altitude—difficulty is distance + vert, not thin air.[^2][^6][^3]

Sources:[^14][^15][^3][^4][^5][^10][^9]

## REDDIT / FORUM DEEP DIVE

- Detailed Traka 360 talk lives mostly in long‑form ride reports and tech galleries, not big Reddit threads; Gravel Earth and Velo treat it as “European Unbound” with huge pro fields.[^1][^8][^3][^4]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| km | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0–135 km | Flowing early sectors outside Girona | VOOM/Ben Turner: first 135 km in “under five and a half hours with a group of German riders,” feels great but burns matches if over‑paced. [^10][^9] |  |
| Mid‑race rough sectors | Rough/MTB‑like gravel | CW: “some sections being questionably rough and better suited to a mountain bike”; Laka echoes 85% gravel with rougher chunks mid‑course. [^5][^6] |  |
| Late – “Garmin Hill” | Steepest climb of day | VOOM calls Garmin Hill “the steepest, slowest, most brutal climb of the day,” deep into the ride; a decisive suffering point. [^9] |  |
| Final flat run | Long flat drag back to Girona | After Garmin Hill and “one more climb,” VOOM describes a long flat roll home where fatigue and headwind can make riders crawl. [^9] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- **Garmin Hill late in the 360** is repeatedly highlighted as the iconic brutal climb that breaks people after 250–300+ km.[^10][^9]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No official % breakdown, but BIKEPACKING.com notes for 560 km Adventure “a number of racers didn’t even make it up the first mountain pass before quitting due to steepness, altitude, and ruggedness,” and later flooded lower route led to “laughably slow” progress.[^3]
- VOOM and Ben Turner both frame finishing 360 in ~18 h as a huge achievement, implying many don’t make time cut.[^9][^10]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Accumulated fatigue from riding 12–20 hours with 3,000+ m vert.[^5][^10][^9]
2. Heat and dehydration in midday sun; long stretches between meaningful resupply if mis‑planned.[^5][^9]
3. Mechanical/comfort issues from rough sectors: flats, hand/back pain, saddle issues over 360 km.[^13][^5]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Likely after mid‑course rough sectors and Garmin Hill, when pace drops sharply; slow riders may miss time checks before the final flat drag.[^4][^3][^9]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- CyclingWeekly: “Bigger is always better when it comes to the best gravel bike tire choice at The Traka… some sections being questionably rough and better suited to a mountain bike… I was lucky to be able to fit 50mm tires.”[^5]
- Lachlan Morton (EF): “The general idea is to try and squeeze in as big of tires as possible… I’m riding 44mm Vittoria Mezcals that basically max out the capacity of the frame.”[^16]
- Laka and tech galleries show most 360 riders on 40–45 mm at least, many running MTB‑ish treads (Mezcal, Thunder Burt, etc.).[^16][^6][^13][^5]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Flats and rim strikes on rougher descents and rockier tracks when running lighter casings.[^13][^5]
- General wear from 12–20 h: drivetrain contamination if wet/flooded, saddle/post issues, lights/batteries failing for back‑of‑pack.[^3][^9]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Lachlan’s 2025 setup: 50/34 chainrings with 11–34 cassette, showing strong riders run relatively big road‑ish gearing but still need 1:1 low gear for steep climbs late.[^16]
- Average riders likely benefit from sub‑1:1 ratios (e.g., 40×42+), given Garmin Hill and long day.[^9][^5]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More cushion/volume: CW’s headline lesson is “never too much cushion,” praising 50 mm tires.[^5]
- Better pacing and fueling strategy; VOOM frames 360 as “long, hard, beautiful, and brutally honest,” requiring locked‑in nutrition.[^9]

Sources:[^6][^4][^10][^16][^3][^13][^9][^5]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Girona (GRO) and Barcelona (BCN) serve the event; Girona is the cycling hub.[^1][^4][^3]

**Lodging:**

- Girona is packed with cycling accommodation; Traka week draws huge numbers, so hotels/apartments book out early near the old town and event village.[^8][^1][^4][^3]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish near Girona center; urban logistics, but nothing like US rural chaos—most riders walk/ride from lodgings.[^1][^4]

**Packet pickup:**

- Velo notes 360/200 on Saturday, 100/50 on Sunday, with packet pickup for 100/50 on Saturday evening “just as the first 360 finisher is predicted to come in.”[^1]

**Local tips:**

- BIKEPACKING: calls Traka “the European equivalent of Unbound, the Met Gala of bikes,” meaning sponsor presence, tech, and crowds.[^3]
- Gravel Earth: positions Traka as centerpiece of series—expect full‑on pro scene plus big amateur weekend.[^11][^4]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Developed over last several years as Girona’s flagship gravel event; Gravel Earth notes Traka has “grown from under‑the‑radar locals‑only event to one of the largest and best‑known in Europe.”[^8][^4]

**Origin story:**

- Hosted in Girona, current European gravel hub; event designed to showcase Catalan dirt and to serve as Euro counterpart to Unbound.[^8][^1][^3]

**How it's evolved:**

- Started with 360/200/100/50; added 560 km Traka Adventure for 2024+, bringing in ultra specialists.[^14][^4][^3]
- Course changed under extreme weather in 2024 (snow, flooding) but 360 remained big‑loop gravel epic.[^14][^3]

**How community talks about it:**

- Framed as **European Unbound** / “Met Gala of bikes”: all the brands, pros, and influencers.[^4][^8][^1][^3]
- Riders call it “long, hard, beautiful, and brutally honest,” a true test even if terrain isn’t as extreme as some ultra bikepacking races.[^3][^9]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to Unbound: similar epic status and pack racing but less rock/mud, more fast gravel and rough sectors; more European vibe and no Flint Hills.[^1][^3]
- Compared to Oregon Trail/Migration: one massive day instead of stage race; lower altitude but heavy on distance and tech‑ish sectors.[^10][^3][^5]

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Official ride details: “multi‑surface mele’ consists of county asphalt roads, trails, single track, technical challenges, a ridiculous amount of punchy steep climbs, rolling hills, a river, a creek, a cowboy bar, and some creative shenanigan’s thrown in for good times.”[^21]
- Gravel Bike California guide: calls Cobbler “one of gravel's hardest and most beloved events,” emphasizing steep dirt walls, off‑camber singletrack, and weird features.[^23]

**Technical sections:**

- GBC 2023 course video: “insane 45 percent grade hike a bike section” followed by more singletrack and bizarre obstacles like a shopping cart on course.[^29]
- Rodeo Labs 2024: riders “threaded a singletrack cow path up a valley, then transitioned to a ridge, then pushed our bike up a few walls, then whooped our way down into the next valley,” showing real MTB‑style terrain.[^30]

**Notable climbs:**

- Numerous ultra‑steep dirt walls; 45%‑grade hike‑a‑bike from GBC is the most viral example.[^22][^21][^29]
- 2025 POV: 30‑minute climb with mud turning rideable grades into hike‑a‑bike as front wheel stuck and stiff shoes made walking hard.[^20]

**Problem areas:**

- Mud surprise: 2025 rider expected dry and instead found “it kept getting muddier and muddier… front wheel kept getting stuck in the mud,” making walking with stiff shoes extremely hard.[^20]
- Hike‑a‑bike walls and sketchy off‑camber cow paths are where crashes and frustration happen when riders are gassed.[^29][^30][^23]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 (Cobbler 11.0) | Stage 21 recap: “The 2024 Rock Cobbler lived up to its reputation, throwing a curveball to riders who braced for mud after pre-race rain.” Actual race: mud present in spots but course mostly rideable; recent rains made some hiking/product‑testing sections extra interesting, but not a full mud‑fest. [^31][^30][^25] | Rodeo Labs: pre‑race concern if “recent rains [would] render it largely unrideable, a destroyer of souls and of drivetrains?” They found walls and cow‑paths rideable/hikeable with lots of grit but not total disaster. [^30] |
| 2023 | GBC POV shows dry green hills with surprise mud sections partway up a long climb; “I had not expected mud whatsoever because it wasn’t raining… kept getting muddier and muddier.” [^29] | Mud turned climb into deep, sticky mess requiring walking in stiff shoes; front wheel stuck repeatedly. [^29] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- February in Bakersfield: cool mornings, mild afternoons; green hills in videos show winter‑spring grass; mud risk depends on prior rain.[^23][^20][^29]

**Primary risk:**

- Unpredictable mud on steep walls and cow paths plus the sheer vert; weather can flip from hero dirt to peanut‑butter sections without race‑day rain.[^31][^30][^20][^29]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Low‑altitude California foothills; climbing is steep and punchy but no altitude issues.[^21][^23]

## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Approx. section | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Early/first half | “Walls” / hike‑a‑bike ramps | GBC: “insane 45 percent grade hike a bike section” plus multiple dirt walls; riders push bikes up near‑impossible pitches. [^29][^21] |  |
| Mid‑course long climb | 30‑minute climb with surprise mud | 2025 POV: climb starts dry and gets progressively muddier; front wheel sticks, stiff shoes make walking miserable; traction almost zero. [^20] |  |
| Cow‑path ridges | Singletrack cow paths and ridges | Rodeo Labs: “threaded a singletrack cow path up a valley, then transitioned to a ridge, then pushed our bike up a few walls, then whooped our way down.” Technical and exposed when tired. [^30] |  |
| Late | Final shenanigans / urban bits | GBC shows weird obstacles such as shopping carts, random urban/off‑road connectors, keeping riders on guard until the end. [^29][^23] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- The **ultra‑steep hike‑a‑bike walls (including ~45% grade)** are the defining suffering zones; they’re deliberately built into the “World Famous” identity.[^30][^29][^23][^21]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No official %; Stage 21 and Rodeo describe finishers as “defying the odds,” implying significant attrition, especially in muddy years.[^27][^31][^30]

**Most common reasons (inferred):**

1. Exhaustion from 7–10k ft vert over ~75–80 mi with hike‑a‑bike and technical sections.[^28][^20][^30][^21]
2. Mud‑related drivetrain issues and shoe problems on steep walls in wet years.[^24][^20][^29]
3. Crashes/near‑crashes on steep, loose, or off‑camber cow paths and descents.[^29][^30][^23]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Likely after major walls and long muddy climb mid‑course; slower riders can hemorrhage time hiking.[^27][^30][^21]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Reddit: “As long as you got at least 38c you will be fine… I’m running 48c at the moment, may drop back down to a 44c though.”[^32]
- Another setup: Teravail Rutland 47 front + Maxxis Ravager 40 rear “handled great last year.”[^32]
- Official site: “All routes are designed to be a challenge on a gravel bike, ideally fitted with some fine IRC TIRES. Some say the bigger, the better, then there’s the Feb weather… choose well, Cobbler! MTB’s are great. ROAD BIKES, very bad idea.”[^21]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Chains and drivetrains stressed by mud on steep climbs; 2025 POV: “guys broke their chains” in muddy climb while he only had chain‑handling issues.[^20]
- Flats/sidewall damage less dominant than at rockier races; here the bigger issue is footing and traction.[^30][^29]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Official: “Low gearing is a must.”[^21]
- GBC racer ran MTB derailleur with 11–52 cassette on a gravel frame to get true granny gears, plus dropper post for steep descents.[^29]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More walkable shoes for extended hike‑a‑bike: 2025 POV regrets super‑stiff Bonts on muddy walls.[^20]
- Possibly more dropper travel and bigger tires to cope with technical descending and mud.[^30][^29]

Sources:[^34][^23][^24][^20][^29][^30][^21][^32]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Bakersfield (BFL) is closest; many SoCal riders drive from LA area.[^22][^23]

**Lodging:**

- Bakersfield has standard chain hotels; February is shoulder‑season, so lodging is easier than Steamboat/Emporia but popular hotels near start can still fill with Cobbler riders.[^28][^23]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish around Bakersfield venues; GBC and POVs show standard urban parking lots, no major complaints beyond typical event congestion.[^23][^20]

**Packet pickup:**

- Expo‑lite vibe at local bike shops/venues; shenanigan culture prioritized more than big corporate expo.[^27][^22][^23]

**Local tips:**

- GBC and Rodeo stress that Bakersfield in February can be “outstandingly beautiful” green hills, but also muddy; locals tell people to be ready for both peanut butter and hero dirt.[^23][^29][^30]

- Results list back to “Cobbler 6.0” in 2019; event has at least 11+ editions by 2024 (BMC Rock Cobbler 11.0).[^26]

**Origin story:**

- Designed intentionally as a ridiculous gravel/MTB mash‑up—“World Famous” for hike‑a‑bike walls, shenanigans, and creative obstacles.[^22][^23][^21]

**How it's evolved:**

- Gained sponsors (BMC, Bianchi) and added Boulder ultra‑distance and trail‑run variants; shenanigan elements evolve yearly (bull incident years ago, shopping carts, cowboy bar, etc.).[^26][^23][^21]

**How community talks about it:**

- Frequently labeled one of the **hardest and weirdest gravel events**—“does gravel get any better?” per Rodeo Labs; GBC calls it “most insane gravel course” they’ve done.[^29][^30][^23]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to SBT/Unbound: much shorter, but more technical and gimmicky, with true hike‑a‑bike and steep walls that would never appear in a mass‑market race.[^30][^21][^29]
- Compared to Ned/VO: less altitude, more deliberate insanity; more like a one‑day adventure/gravel enduro than a pure race.[^34][^23][^30]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “The most important factor is tire choice. The first year was peanut butter mud, second kinda the same, and this last year was fairly dry.” – r/gravelcycling.[^32]
2. “All routes are designed to be a challenge on a gravel bike… Some say the bigger, the better, then theres the Feb weather… choose well, Cobbler! MTB’s are great. ROAD BIKES, very bad idea. Low gearing is a must.” – official site.[^21]
3. “We threaded a singletrack cow path up a valley, then transitioned to a ridge, then pushed our bike up a few walls, then whooped our way down into the next valley.” – Rodeo Labs.[^30]
4. “One of the best friends roped us into the Rock Cobbler, a brutal 75.5-mile gravel ride in Bakersfield, California, with 8000 feet of climbing… the only way you can say you won is by simply surviving.” – 2025 POV.[^20]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE

1. “Insane 45 percent grade hike a bike section.” – GBC.[^29]
2. “Rock Cobbler 11: Does gravel get any better?” – Rodeo Labs headline.[^30]
3. “World Famous Rock Cobbler… famous for its vertical hike-a-bike sections.” – official site.[^21]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

- Do steep off‑road climbs and repeated hike‑a‑bike in training; Amanda Nauman: simulate event terrain, not just smooth gravel.[^34]
- Build handling for singletrack, cow paths, and muddy steep ramps on your gravel rig (or MTB).[^23][^29][^30]
- Prepare for variable Feb conditions: be able to ride mud, ruts, and dry hardpack in one day.[^31][^33][^24]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Official DNF % by year and detailed cutoff schedules.
- Exact GPX‑labeled map of all walls and shenanigans for every edition (course changes yearly).

**Conflicting info:**

- Exact mileage/elevation vary year‑to‑year (75–80 mi, 7,800–8,700 ft) and by route (Cobbler vs Boulder).[^22][^20][^21]
