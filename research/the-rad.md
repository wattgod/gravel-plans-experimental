## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Velo: course is “pretty darn smooth and fast” on the plains and much of the climb; a strong rider “could get away with a road bike with 28 or 30mm tires” there.[^4]
- Elitewheels 2025 preview: “over 90% of the routes run on maintained gravel roads, with a short technical section (approx. 2 miles) at Trinidad Lake State Park.”[^1]

**Technical sections:**

- Velo’s ride report: once at the top, they hit “mud and some deep, do‑not‑attempt‑to‑change-your-line ruts that last for a mile or so on a descent,” which are the main true‑tech hazard.[^4]
- Life Time highlights video: describes “technical two track sections, and fast paced descents” in Trinidad Lake State Park area as a defining feature.[^3]

**Notable climbs:**

- Course talk in LT video: from Trinidad, riders roll into gravel and then hit “a series of hills across 6 miles” (the “roller coaster”) before an “18 mile long climb up to 9,000 ft reaching grades of up to 18% at times,” then another climb to the highest point at mile 65.[^3]
- Elitewheels: 110‑mile route has ~10,613 ft climbing with peak near 8,900 ft, confirming long sustained climbing at moderate altitude.[^1]

**Problem areas:**

- Velo: top‑of‑course mud and deep ruts on a descent; “do‑not‑attempt‑to‑change‑your‑line ruts” lasted about a mile and caused flats and sketchy handling, especially on narrow tires.[^4]
- Michelle Duffy in LT video: final chunky sector back toward Trinidad Lake is “the area that's most susceptible to flatting,” with the “chunkiest part of the course” before riders reconnect to smoother gravel and pavement into town.[^3]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Life Time highlights: clear views of Spanish Peaks, dry course with some dust; commentary focuses on heat and attrition rather than mud. [^3] | Race called “a race of attrition” with heat and big climbs splitting groups more than weather events. [^3] |
| 2023 | Velo’s “Riding the Rad in Trinidad” report: encountered mud and deep ruts at the top despite mostly fast/smooth surfaces elsewhere, implying localized wet conditions. [^4] | Muddy descent added a sketchy, line‑committing section; otherwise a mix of smooth fast gravel and some chunky bits. [^4] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Early fall in Trinidad: cool mornings, warm afternoons; high desert sun plus altitude can make climbs hot even if air temps look mild.[^1][^4]

**Primary risk:**

- Heat and dehydration on long 18‑mile climb and exposed mesas, plus localized mud/rut sections if recent rain hits the top of the course.[^3][^4]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Start in Trinidad (~6,000+ ft); climbs up to ~8,900–9,000 ft at course high point.[^1][^3]

## REDDIT / SOCIAL DEEP DIVE

**Facebook group Q\&A:** “What tips or advice for The Rad Dirt Fest gravel race?”
**URL:** https://www.facebook.com/groups/159294977560554/posts/2795167477306611/[^12]
**Key quotes:**

- “A road bike with clearance for up to 35C tyres and my tyre of choice was a... *ahem* Schwalbe Marathon Plus... yeah yeah I know don't laugh…” – rider describing their setup, hinting that the course is smooth enough in places for silly‑tough tires but that most run gravel bikes.[^12]

**Instagram (official):**
**URL:** https://www.instagram.com/theraddirt[^11]
**Key quotes:**

- “The Rad is nothing short of amazing! From the technical two track, to the ripping champagne gravel coming back into town, there is a perfect blend of terrain.” – event post summarizing terrain mix.[^11]


## TRAINERROAD / FORUMS

- No dense TR thread specific to Rad surfaced; Rad shows up mostly in LT Grand Prix and general gravel discussions as the “Colorado high desert” stop with big climbs and a mix of smooth and chunky.[^7][^3]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~0–6 | Trinidad Lake “roller coaster” | Six‑mile series of hills in the state park early; packs usually stay together, but this starts to sting legs and sort fitness. [^3] |  |
| ~6–24 | 18‑mile climb to ~9,000 ft | Long climb with pitches up to 18%; this is the main selection: heat, altitude, and gradient blow up groups and start the attrition. [^3][^1] |  |
| ~65 | Highest point / chunky top | After another climb to the highest point at mile 65, riders face a “screaming descent downhill for many miles”; at the top there can be mud and deep ruts “do‑not‑attempt‑to‑change‑your‑line” for about a mile on the descent. [^3][^4] |  |
| Late gravel back to park | Chunky sector near Trinidad Lake | Duffy: this is “the area that's most susceptible to flatting… the chunkiest part of the course,” right before fast run‑in to town and steep pavement rollers. [^3][^1] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- The **18‑mile climb to ~9,000 ft** plus the **muddy/rutted top‑of‑course descent and late chunky sector** are what define the Rad suffering: long, steep altitude grind, then high‑speed risk/flat zones.[^3][^4][^1]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No public % table, but Life Time commentators repeatedly call it “a race of attrition,” showing gaps and riders falling off on long climbs and in chunky sectors.[^7][^3]

**Most common reasons (inferred):**

1. Pacing and altitude failure on the 18‑mile climb and subsequent climbs, especially in heat.[^1][^3]
2. Flats and rim damage on chunky late‑course sectors and muddy/rutted descent; Velo lost a flat‑fixing keg on a dry descent, showing how rough high‑speed sections are.[^4][^3]
3. Dehydration and nutrition mistakes over 110/70 miles with big vert.[^8][^1]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Likely after the highest‑point climb and on the return through chunky sectors if far off pace; athlete guide enforces time limits with sweeps.[^9][^8]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Velo: “despite the fast and smooth sections, I’d recommend a 35mm or 40mm tire.”[^4]
- Elitewheels: “over 90% maintained gravel… short technical section (~2 miles) at Trinidad Lake State Park,” implying that ~38–42 mm gravel tires balance speed and safety.[^1]
- FB rider used 35 mm Schwalbe Marathon Plus on a road bike and finished, but that’s more overbuilt touring than optimal race tire.[^12]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Flats and ejected bottles/kegs on rough descents: Velo reports their flat‑fixing keg getting launched on a dry descent, with deep ruts and rocks at the top causing flats in some conditions.[^4]
- General LT guide warns to carry own spares/repair kit because aid stations may not have everything; Rad’s remoteness makes self‑support crucial.[^8][^9]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- 18‑mile climb with sections to 18% at ~6–9k ft altitude suggests sub‑1:1 gearing is wise; pros can push bigger, but average riders need proper low gears.[^3][^1]

**What people wish they'd brought (implied):**

- Slightly bigger tires (35–40 mm) rather than skinny road sizes, to handle ruts and chunky late‑course sections.[^1][^4]
- Better bottle retention or on‑body hydration to avoid losing kegs/bottles on rough descents.[^8][^4]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Trinidad is in southern Colorado; nearest major airports are Denver (DEN) and Colorado Springs (COS), with a several‑hour drive; local/regional options via Pueblo or TX/OK panhandle sometimes used.[^1]

**Lodging:**

- Elitewheels: describes Rad as “set against the towering Spanish Peaks and sweeping mesas of Southern Colorado,” with riders staying in Trinidad and surrounding area; event weekend likely sells out local hotels/campsites.[^11][^1]

**Parking:**

- Start in downtown Trinidad, roll‑out through town and state park; Life Time course highlight shows a big event footprint but no specific parking complaints.[^8][^3]

**Packet pickup:**

- Athlete guide covers check‑in, timing, and mandatory gear; Rad follows standard Life Time protocols across events.[^9][^8]

**Local tips:**

- Velo emphasizes that while plains/climb sections may feel “road‑bikeable,” the top mud/ruts and chunky sectors mean a gravel bike with 35–40 mm tires is safer/faster overall.[^4]
- Instagram: organizers trumpet the mix of “technical two track” and “ripping champagne gravel coming back into town” as what makes the Rad “nothing short of amazing.”[^11]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Inaugural Rad Dirt Fest ran in 2021; CyclingNews notes Lauren De Crescenzo winning the inaugural 110‑mile event and finishing second overall.[^7]

**Origin story:**

- Created by Life Time in Trinidad to showcase “gravel roads rarely experienced,” with Spanish Peaks backdrops and high‑desert terrain, as part of their broader gravel portfolio.[^11][^1]

**How it's evolved:**

- Quickly folded into the Life Time Grand Prix; 2024 was stop \#5 of the LTGP with extended broadcast highlights.[^7][^3]
- 2025 edition added UNBOUND Gravel qualifier coin allocation for 110‑ and 70‑mile finishers.[^1]

**How community talks about it:**

- Described as scenic and “nothing short of amazing,” with a mix of technical two‑track and fast champagne gravel, plus big climbs that make it a real challenge even for seasoned riders.[^11][^4][^1]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to Unbound: smoother for long stretches, less mud overall, but more altitude and one huge 18‑mile climb.[^4][^1]
- Compared to Ned Gravel: similar Colorado vert and altitude but Rad’s terrain is more plains + mesa, less sustained technical rocky railroad‑grade.[^4][^1]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “The course surface, for the most part, is pretty darn smooth and fast. On the plains and much of the climb, you could get away with a road bike with 28 or 30mm tires for sure. However! Once at the top, we encountered mud and some deep, do-not-attemp-to-change-your-line ruts that last for a mile or so on a descent.” – Velo.[^4]
2. “All that to say… despite the fast and smooth sections, I’d recommend a 35mm or 40mm tire.” – same.[^4]
3. “The Rad is nothing short of amazing! From the technical two track, to the ripping champagne gravel coming back into town, there is a perfect blend of terrain.” – official IG.[^11]
4. “We start in downtown Trinidad, Colorado and roll out onto gravel… then begin an 18 mile long climb up to 9,000 ft reaching grades of up to 18% at times.” – Michelle Duffy, LT broadcast.[^3]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “Do-not-attempt-to-change-your-line ruts” – on the muddy top descent.[^4]
2. “This is the area that's most susceptible to flatting… it's the chunkiest part of the course.” – LT commentary on late‑course sector.[^3]
3. “The Rad is nothing short of amazing!” – organizer hype that actually matches rider reports.[^11]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do reports suggest for prep?

- Train for long climbs at altitude: simulate 60–90 minute climbs and back‑to‑back punchy hills to mimic the 18‑mile climb and later rollers.[^3][^1]
- Practice descending on fast but occasionally rutted/chunky gravel; you want confidence to hold a line in ruts and manage speed on “screaming” descents.[^3][^4]
- Prepare for heat and dehydration: long climbs in exposed high‑desert conditions demand robust hydration and electrolytes.[^8][^1][^3]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Official DNF percentages by year and category.
- Fully detailed GPX‑annotated hazard map with exact mile markers for every rutted/muddy section; most detail is in video commentary and Velo’s narrative.

**Conflicting info:**

- Route naming and exact mileage vary slightly by year (110 vs 113 miles for “Stubborn Delores”; 68 vs 70 miles for “Anteloop”), but elevation and structure (roller coaster, 18‑mile climb, high point, chunky return) are consistent.[^2][^1][^3]
