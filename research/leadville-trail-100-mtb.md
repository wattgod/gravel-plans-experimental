## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Course is mostly dirt roads, doubletrack, and some paved sections; **not** a technical singletrack race, but rougher than typical gravel: rutted jeep roads, loose rock, and a few rocky descents.[^7][^8][^5]
- A TrainerRoad thread sums it up: “Leadville is not a technical MTB course. But it is technical compared to a typical gravel course,” especially on descents like Powerline and Columbine.[^7]

**Technical sections:**

- Powerline descent (outbound): steep, loose, and deeply rutted; one 2024 recap: “The bottom of Powerline is terrifyingly steep and fast… the top half is rocky, loose, and rutted out.”[^4]
- The Leadville race blog’s “Dispatches from Columbine” stresses that you can’t let your mind wander on Powerline: it’s where real MTB skills matter.[^9]

**Notable climbs:**

- **Columbine Mine climb:** ~7 miles, 3,000 ft of gain, starting around 9,200 ft and topping near 12,500 ft.[^3][^10][^4]
- **Powerline climb (inbound):** roughly 1,500 ft of climbing, with brutally steep pitches after 70+ miles in the legs; often described as the hardest effort of the day.[^11][^5][^3]
- St Kevins (outbound) and Sugarloaf climbs bookend early/late efforts but are shorter than Columbine.[^8][^5]

**Problem areas:**

- Powerline descent outbound is the highest‑risk crash zone (steep, loose, rutted, braking bumps); inbound Powerline climb is the key “blow‑up” spot where cramping and walking are common.[^5][^4][^8]
- Upper Columbine gets steep, rocky, and above tree line; air is thin, trail narrows, and riders are often forced to walk the final pitches, especially mid‑pack.[^12][^10][^4]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Typical high‑altitude summer: cold start, strong sun mid‑day, possible storms; 2024 recaps focus more on altitude and pacing than extreme weather. [^4] | Race ran full distance, fast pro times; no major weather‑induced course changes. [^4][^11] |
| 2023 | Similar pattern; 2023 recap notes cool morning, warm afternoon, and a lot of dust on descents like Powerline. [^5] | Traction mostly dry/loose; crashes more about loose rock than mud. [^5] |
| Historic | Leadville can see cold rain/hail in the afternoon; athlete guides warn of quickly changing mountain weather and thunderstorms above treeline. [^2][^6] | Riders are required to carry weather‑appropriate gear; DNFs sometimes tied to hypothermia in wet years. [^2] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Start temps often near freezing in town; can reach 60s–70s F at lower sections by afternoon, but high points (Columbine summit) can stay cold and windy.[^2][^6]

**Primary risk:**

- Altitude plus temp swings; risk of hypothermia in storms vs dehydration and sunburn when clear.[^6][^2]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Start: ~10,152 ft; Columbine summit: ~12,500 ft.[^1][^10][^3]

**Thread:** “Leadville 100 mountain bike race recap.”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/p7ilem/leadville_100_mountain_bike_race_recap/[^12]
**Key quotes:**

- “Things came apart when I got to the Columbine mine climb. Columbine takes you from an elevation of 9.5k feet to 12.5k feet over 7 miles of what starts as jeep road and turns into rocky doubletrack near the top.” – u/redditor.[^12]
- “I was reduced to walking large chunks near the top; the combo of altitude and grade is savage.” – same recap.[^12]

**Thread:** “Leadville reality check”
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-reality-check/78261[^7]
**Key quotes:**

- “Leadville is not a technical MTB course. But it is technical compared to a typical gravel course. There will be sections descending where you will need to go slower than the people around you unless you have good MTB skills.” – TR user.[^7]

**Thread:** “Leadville 100 tire setup — Aspen STs, low pressure and inserts”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/xcmtb/comments/1kz9610/leadville_100_tire_setup_aspen_sts_low_pressure/[^13]
**Key quotes:**

- “I believe inserts are unnecessary for Leadville; the only challenging section is the descent from Columbine, and I was cruising past many riders without really pushing my limits. If you've tackled Moab Rocks, you'll find Leadville to be relatively straightforward in terms of technicality. However, the physical demands are a different matter.” – u/BCMulx.[^13]
- Another commenter counters: “There’s no way I'd go for a Burt at Leadville—it's just too flat and unpredictable… plenty of flats and damaged rims on Powerline last year.” – same thread.[^13]

**Thread:** “Mtn.Bike tires for Leadville 100”
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1lirucl/mtnbike_tires_for_leadville_100/[^14]
**Key quote:**

- “Leadville is basically double track and non technical, so you're not super traction limited. I'd personally ride either a Maxxis Aspen or a Maxxis Rekon… and consider a tire insert to allow for lower pressure.” – u/Outside-Today-1814.[^14]


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

**Thread:** “Leadville reality check”
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/leadville-reality-check/78261[^7]
**Key quote:**

- “If you’re comfortable descending rocky jeep roads and some ruts, you’ll be fine; if your background is pure road / gravel, Powerline will feel sketchy.” – paraphrased consensus.[^7]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~40–50 | Columbine Mine climb (outbound) | 7‑mile, 3,000‑ft climb from ~9.5k to 12.5k ft; many mid‑pack riders ride lower half and hike upper, blowing pacing and burning matches for rest of race. [^3][^4][^12][^10] |  |
| ~60–75 | Return over Columbine and Pipeline rollers | After the Columbine descent, riders hit the rolling Pipeline section; Dylan Johnson’s recap shows groups trading pulls at altitude while riders who overdid Columbine crack. [^11][^5] |  |
| ~78–82 | Powerline climb (inbound) | Steepest pitches of the day, late in race; normalized power numbers from Dylan’s video show ~258 W for 9 minutes (308 W sea‑level equivalent) 5 hours in, gassing even pros. [^11][^5] |  |
| ~90–100 | Carter Summit \& final rollers | Tired riders chasing 9/12‑hour buckles suffer here; climb isn’t as steep as Powerline but comes when glycogen is low and breathing is hard. [^2][^6][^5] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- **Inbound Powerline climb** is universally described as the decisive “soul‑crusher”: steep, exposed, late in the day, and absolutely unforgiving if you mis‑paced Columbine.[^11][^8][^5][^3]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- Official series doesn’t publish percentages in a neat table, but with 1,600+ starters and strict cutoffs, back‑of‑pack attrition is significant; Wikipedia notes multiple time‑check cutoffs where failure to depart results in DNF.[^15][^1][^2]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Missing time cutoffs at Twin Lakes Return (mile 63.2), Pipeline Return (78.5), or Carter Summit (92.8) due to pacing and altitude issues.[^1][^2][^6]
2. Altitude‑related exhaustion and GI issues: riders from sea level often under‑perform power and struggle with nausea above 10k ft.[^5][^4][^12]
3. Crashes or mechanicals on Powerline and Columbine descents (flats, broken rims, bent derailleurs).[^8][^4][^13]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Official guide: Twin Lakes Return (mile 63.2) cutoff window 3:15–3:50 p.m. for 9‑hour/12‑hour pacing; Outward Bound (78.5) at 4:00 p.m.; Carter Summit (92.8) at 6:20 p.m.; finish cutoff 6:15–6:50 p.m. (12‑hour).[^2][^6]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Many experienced racers run fast XC tires: Maxxis Aspen / Aspen ST, Rekon Race, Schwalbe Racing Ralph or similar 2.2–2.4” options.[^16][^17][^14][^13]
- Redditers debate inserts: some say “inserts are unnecessary” because tech is moderate; others recommend lightweight inserts to protect rims on Powerline/Columbine while allowing lower pressures.[^14][^13]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Flats and rim damage on Powerline descent; users report “plenty of flats and damaged rims on Powerline last year.”[^8][^5][^13]
- Chain drops and derailleur issues on rough jeep‑road sections if shifting under load over rocks.[^5][^8]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Most run modern XC 1x (32–34T front, 50T rear) or doubles that give ~0.7–0.8:1 granny; being slightly under‑geared is considered better than over‑geared for Columbine and Powerline at altitude.[^17][^4][^5]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More conservative gearing or pacing on Columbine; multiple race reports describe blowing up by pacing Columbine like a standalone climb rather than the midpoint of the race.[^4][^5][^12]
- Either more descending confidence (skills) or slightly beefier tires for Powerline; some riders regret ultra‑light casings after flats on the descent.[^4][^13][^8]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Denver International (DEN) is the main fly‑in; drive to Leadville is roughly 2–3 hours over the mountains.[^2]

**Lodging:**

- Leadville lodging sells out months in advance; many stay in Leadville, Buena Vista, Twin Lakes, or camp/RV near town. Long‑time racers recommend booking as soon as you get a lottery/qualifier spot.[^2][^5]

**Parking:**

- Athlete guide shows designated parking and shuttle/flow around the start/finish; with 1,600+ riders plus crews, race‑morning arrival timing is crucial.[^6][^2]

**Packet pickup:**

- Multi‑day event: expo and packet pickup Friday, mandatory athlete briefing, and optional pre‑ride shakeouts.[^6][^2]

**Local tips:**

- Leadville Race Series blog repeatedly stresses arriving early to acclimate to 10,000 ft and practicing long, steady climbs akin to Columbine and Powerline.[^9][^3]
- Spectator logistics: Mountain Project thread notes Twin Lakes and Powerline as prime viewing spots for crews and fans.[^18]

## YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS

| Video | Channel | URL | Key Insight | Best Comments |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “Going Deep at 12000ft (3600m)! Leadville Trail 100 Race …” | Dylan Johnson | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNQ6ANOELO4 [^11] | Breaks race into segments (St Kevins, Sugarloaf/Powerline, Pipeline, Columbine, return) and overlays power numbers and altitude, showing how pros pace climbs and where groups form/split. [^11] | Shows NP ~275 W for 25 min to stay with front group and ~258 W for 9 min up inbound Powerline 5 hours in, which contextualizes just how hard those sections are. |
| Various 2023–2024 POVs | Multiple | YouTube search [^11][^5] | Helmet‑cam on Powerline/Columbine shows ruts, rocks, and hike‑a‑bike sections mid‑pack. | Comments frequently argue about whether Leadville is “technical enough to justify a full‑suspension,” with many saying yes for comfort. |

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- First run in 1994 as part of the Leadville Race Series, growing into one of the most prestigious 100‑mile MTB races in the world.[^1][^2]

**Origin story:**

- Created originally to help revive the Leadville mining town economy by bringing endurance events to the high country; MTB race followed the 100‑mile run.[^1][^2]

**How it's evolved:**

- Course broadly consistent (out‑and‑back to Columbine and back via Powerline), with incremental changes in aid‑station logistics and cutoff enforcement; now part of Lifetime Grand Prix.[^6][^2]

**How community talks about it:**

- Often described as a **fitness and altitude test more than a technical MTB race**; but anyone who downplays its descents gets pushback from those who’ve crashed on Powerline.[^13][^8][^7]
- Belt buckles (big at <9 hours, small at <12) drive pacing obsession and create a strong time‑goal culture.[^1][^2]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to SBT or Unbound: smoother in some parts but much higher and more climbing; less mud (usually), more altitude.[^5][^7]
- Compared to more technical XC marathons: less singletrack/tech, more fire roads and doubletrack, but the altitude and distance make it uniquely punishing.[^13][^7]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “Leadville's biggest climb, Columbine, will take most amateurs 1–3 hours to complete.” – The Pro’s Closet 2024 recap.[^4]
2. “The bottom of Powerline is terrifyingly steep and fast! … If you’re not a confident descender, this might be the WORST section for you.” – same recap.[^4]
3. “Leadville is not a technical MTB course. But it is technical compared to a typical gravel course.” – TrainerRoad user.[^7]
4. “Columbine takes you from an elevation of 9.5k feet to 12.5k feet over 7 miles… I was reduced to walking large chunks near the top.” – Reddit race recap.[^12]
5. “There’s no way I'd go for a Burt at Leadville—it's just too flat and unpredictable… plenty of flats and damaged rims on Powerline last year.” – u/BCMulx.[^13]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “I could actually smell people cooking their brakes [on Powerline].” – 2024 recap.[^4]
2. “If you've tackled Moab Rocks, you'll find Leadville to be relatively straightforward in terms of technicality. However, the physical demands are a different matter, haha.” – u/BCMulx.[^13]
3. “Leadville 100 MTB is basically double track and non technical… I’d personally ride either a Maxxis Aspen or a Maxxis Rekon.” – u/Outside-Today-1814.[^14]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do forums/videos recommend for prep?

- Long, steady climbing at altitude (or simulated) focusing on two key climbs: ~3,000 ft Columbine and ~1,500 ft Powerline; Leadville blog explicitly calls these out as focus points.[^3][^9][^11]
- Pacing discipline: multiple recaps stress riding within yourself up Columbine to save for inbound Powerline and the last 20 miles.[^11][^5][^4]
- Altitude acclimation: arrive early if possible; many race reports attribute under‑performance to arriving only a day or two before and not adjusting.[^3][^5][^12]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact per‑year DNF percentages and broken‑out reasons (crash vs cutoff vs voluntary pull).
- Full official map with every hazard labeled; most technical knowledge is from rider POVs and forums.

**Conflicting info:**

- Total elevation quoted varies (11k vs 12k+ ft) due to device differences and minor course adjustments.[^3][^5][^4]
