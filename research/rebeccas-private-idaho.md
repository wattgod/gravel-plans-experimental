# REBECCA’S PRIVATE IDAHO (KETCHUM/SUN VALLEY, ID) - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Generated: December 28, 2025

## OFFICIAL DATA

| Field | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Distance | “Baked Potato” ~102–103 mi; “Fully Loaded Baked Potato” adds the original Copper Basin loop (longer, more vert); shorter “French Fry” ~56–60 mi; “Tater Tot” ~20 mi; plus a 4‑day Queen’s Stage Race (QSR). [^1][^2][^3] | [^1][^2][^3] |
| Elevation | Baked Potato ~6,000 ft climbing over ~103 mi; QSR Stage 4 “Baked Potato” 165 km with just under 1,900 m (~6,200 ft) climbing in MyVeloFit’s 2024 report. [^4][^5][^2] | [^4][^5][^2] |
| Location | Ketchum / Sun Valley, Idaho; routes head over Trail Creek Summit into Copper Basin and surrounding Big Lost River high desert. [^1][^2][^3] | [^1][^2][^3] |
| Date (2025/2026) | Labor Day weekend; 2024 ran over the first weekend in September (stage race Thurs–Sun, Baked Potato Sunday). [^4][^6][^1] | [^4][^6][^1] |
| Field size | Cobalt Bikes report: “over 700 riders registered for the Baked Potato alone, ~560 started,” plus stage racers and shorter distances. [^7] | [^7] |
| Entry cost | Tiered by event: QSR (4‑day) premium; single‑day Baked/French Fry/Tater Tot cheaper. Exact pricing varies by year, listed on reg portal. [^1][^3] | [^1][^3] |
| Cutoff time | Published in rider guide (not fully quoted online); Baked Potato is an all‑day event with time checks but generous enough for strong recreational riders. [^3] | [^3] |
| Aid stations | Multiple stocked aid stations on Baked Potato and QSR stages; MyVeloFit mentions multiple fuel stops and neutral support along 165 km course. [^4][^5][^3] | [^4][^5][^3] |
| Registration type | Online via rebeccasprivateidaho.com; QSR limited capped field, plus open mass‑start Baked/French Fry/Tater Tot. [^1][^3] | [^1][^3] |
| Website | https://www.rebeccasprivateidaho.com [^1] | [^1] |

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Trailforks: Baked Potato is a 102‑mile “gravel bike only” route; it’s almost all gravel/dirt with minimal pavement, mostly Forest Service roads, washboard, and some rougher two‑track.[^2]
- MyVeloFit’s 2024 recap: “over 140kms of gravel roads including a 10 kilometer run of pretty intense double track, ‘El Diablito’.”[^4]

**Technical sections:**

- “El Diablito”: described as 10 km of “pretty intense double track,” the roughest sector on the 2024 Baked Potato stage; requires good handling and line choice late in the day.[^4]
- Rodeo Labs 2023 report calls parts of Copper Basin “rough, washboard heavy, and loose,” stressing that while not singletrack‑tech, it’s enough to punish under‑tired setups.[^5]

**Notable climbs:**

- Trail Creek climb: MyVeloFit: “The stage starts off with about 10kms of rolling paved roads before riding into the Trail Creek climb, a 7km climb up the mountain that really blew the race wide open.”[^4]
- Copper Basin rollers: Baked Potato and the Fully Loaded variant add extended high‑desert rollers and false flats at altitude, stacking climbing through the middle hours.[^3][^5]

**Problem areas:**

- El Diablito doubletrack arrives late in the Baked Potato queen stage when riders already have ~100 km+ in their legs; MyVeloFit calls it “pretty intense,” and Rodeo Labs notes it’s where fatigue plus roughness magnify mistakes.[^5][^4]
- Washboard and loose gravel in Copper Basin: long, straight, headwind‑prone sectors where riders battling dehydration and crosswinds can mentally crack.[^3][^5]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | MyVeloFit: “We lucked out again weather wise with a clear and beautiful sunny day” for the 165 km Baked Potato stage. [^4] | Rebecca’s 2024 wrap‑up calls the event “legendary” with no major weather disruptions mentioned. [^6][^8] |
| 2023 | Rodeo Labs: Baked Potato (103 mi / ~6k ft) had “weather looked like it would be rather mild” with some wind but mainly a hard, dry day. [^5] | Focus on pace/nutrition and rough sectors rather than weather. [^5] |
| Early years | Copper Basin and Trail Creek are high enough that cold mornings and afternoon storms are possible; rider guides warn of mountain weather and recommend layers. [^1][^3] | Some years line tweaks (e.g., Fully Loaded Baked Potato) but no widely reported full‑course weather cancellations. [^6][^3] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Early September in Sun Valley: cool mornings (40s F), afternoons in 70s–80s F on exposed gravel; big temperature swings and strong high‑altitude sun.[^1][^3]

**Primary risk:**

- Dehydration and sun exposure on long, dusty Copper Basin roads, especially if riders treat Trail Creek like a short punch instead of the opener of a 100‑mile day.[^5][^4]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Ketchum is ~5,800 ft; Trail Creek Summit and Copper Basin sections climb significantly higher into high‑desert basin terrain.[^2][^1][^3]

Sources:[^6][^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

## REDDIT DEEP DIVE

(There isn’t a rich set of RPI‑specific Reddit tech threads the way there is for Unbound; most detail sits in blogs and brand write‑ups.)

- RPI gets mentioned in “best gravel races” lists and tire‑choice threads as a high‑altitude, big‑day event, but with less mile‑by‑mile breakdown than Unbound or BWR.[^9][^10]


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

- No dedicated RPI thread with the sort of quote density seen for Leadville or BWR; RPI usually appears in “bucket‑list gravel” lists alongside races like SBT and Vermont Overland.[^11][^9]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile / km | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~10–17 km | Trail Creek climb | Early 7 km climb that “really blew the race wide open”; riders who go too hard here pay later in Copper Basin and El Diablito. [^4][^5] |  |
| Mid‑Baked (~50–80 mi) | Copper Basin high desert | Exposed gravel with washboard and false flats; wind and sun drain legs and motivation when the day still has hours left. [^5][^3] |  |
| ~140–150 km of QSR Stage 4 | “El Diablito” doubletrack | 10 km of “pretty intense” two‑track late in the 165 km queen stage; fatigue + rough terrain create crashes, flats, and major slowdowns. [^4][^5] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- Trail Creek + El Diablito combined: Trail Creek sets the tone; El Diablito is remembered as the signature late‑race test for the queen stage.[^4][^5]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- Cobalt report: “over 700 registered, 560 started” for Baked Potato alone, demonstrating some attrition before the start; actual DNF counts aren’t given, but stage‑race format (QSR) adds cumulative fatigue and attrition over days.[^7][^12]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Pacing errors on Trail Creek and mid‑course rollers, leading to bonks in Copper Basin and El Diablito.[^5][^4]
2. Nutrition/hydration failures on a 165 km, mostly‑gravel day; MyVeloFit frames their personal goal as “don’t blow up,” highlighting how easy it is to overreach.[^4]
3. Mechanical issues (flats, drivetrain stress) on washboard and doubletrack when riders push tired bikes through rough sectors.[^5]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Likely mid‑to‑late Baked Potato checkpoints on the QSR day; details live in rider guide, but any cutoffs would be hit by those who blow themselves on Trail Creek and limp into Copper Basin.[^12][^3]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- MyVeloFit and Rodeo Labs both show riders on 38–45 mm gravel tires; emphasis is on durable casings and decent volume rather than knobby MTB rubber.[^4][^5]
- Ted King’s general gravel tire guidance (not RPI‑specific but relevant): “Wider is better. If it's technical then I opt for knobs. Tubeless is your friend.”[^10]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Punctures and burps on washboarded Copper Basin sections and rough two‑track; Rodeo Labs recounts the need to manage pressure carefully.[^5]
- Dust and washboard contribute to drivetrain noise and chain drops if shifting under load on rough climbing.[^3][^5]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Baked Potato’s ~6,000 ft over ~100+ miles at altitude means most riders favor sub‑1:1 lowest gear (e.g., 40x44 or similar) on 1x; stage‑racers especially want spinning gears for Trail Creek and late rollers.[^4][^5]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More disciplined pacing and fueling; multiple accounts focus on avoiding “blowing up” as the central lesson.[^5][^4]
- Slightly more volume or comfort: riders speak of El Diablito and washboard as punishing for under‑tired, very stiff race bikes.[^4][^5]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Sun Valley airport (Friedman Memorial, SUN) serves Ketchum; many also fly into Boise (BOI) and drive.[^1]

**Lodging:**

- RPI rider guide emphasizes that early September is shoulder season—“less traffic, cheaper lodging, more solitude”—but Ketchum/Sun Valley can still book up around RPI weekend.[^3]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish in downtown Ketchum; event has festival atmosphere and central staging; no major parking complaints in race reports.[^6][^1]

**Packet pickup:**

- Multi‑day festival with expo, registration, and rider meetings; QSR riders have additional briefings on daily stages and logistics.[^6][^1][^3]

**Local tips:**

- RPI dispatches emphasize the community/safari vibe: group rides, charity components, and Sun Valley’s outdoor culture are a big part of the draw, not just the race.[^1][^6]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- First RPI held in 2013; race results archive shows history from 2013 onward.[^12][^6]

**Origin story:**

- Created by endurance legend Rebecca Rusch to showcase Idaho’s gravel, raise funds for her foundation, and build a community‑first “gravel festival” in Sun Valley.[^1][^6]

**How it's evolved:**

- Added Queen’s Stage Race (multi‑day) and Tater Tot 20‑miler over time; “Fully Loaded Baked Potato” now includes original Copper Basin loop again, going “further east and higher into the sky than ever before.”[^3][^6][^1]

**How community talks about it:**

- Frequently listed among “best gravel races” and bucket‑list events for its scenery, community, and stage‑race format.[^9][^6]
- Riders cite it as both a serious race and a celebration, with strong charity and social components.[^6][^1][^5]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to Unbound: shorter, higher altitude, less mud, more mountain scenery; still a big‑day 100+‑mile effort with ~6k ft climbing.[^9][^5]
- Compared to pure stage races like Oregon Trail: fewer days, more festival‑style base in one valley, but a queen stage (Baked Potato) that’s on par with major one‑day gravel events.[^13][^4]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “Sunday saw us taking on the queen stage, The Baked Potato, a 165km day with just under 1900m of climbing… My personal goal for the day was to feel strong throughout the entire day… which basically means ‘don’t blow up.’” – MyVeloFit.[^4]
2. “This was a beast of a day with over 140kms of gravel roads including a 10 kilometer run of pretty intense double track, ‘El Diablito’.” – MyVeloFit.[^4]
3. “There were over 700 riders registered for the Baked Potato alone, some deferred or decided not to race as only 560 people started on Sunday.” – Cobalt Bikes.[^7]
4. “The Baked Potato is the biggest stage of the QSR, it is 103 miles with around 6000 ft of elevation. The weather looked like it would be rather mild.” – Rodeo Labs.[^5]
5. “From the gritty, challenging gravel race to the warm moments of community, RPI 2024 was nothing short of legendary.” – Rebecca Rusch.[^8][^6]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “A beast of a day” – MyVeloFit on Baked Potato.[^4]
2. “Pretty intense double track, ‘El Diablito’.” – MyVeloFit.[^4]
3. “Only 560 people started on Sunday” out of 700 registered, hinting at how intimidating the queen stage is.[^7]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do reports suggest for prep?

- Treat Baked Potato as a queen stage: build 6–8 hour gravel endurance at altitude and practice moderate climbs like Trail Creek followed by long tempo on rolling gravel.[^5][^4]
- Emphasize nutrition: 165 km mostly on gravel demands steady fueling; MyVeloFit frames “don’t blow up” as the core mission.[^4]
- Prepare for rough two‑track late in the day: practice riding technical doubletrack on a loaded gravel bike when tired to mimic El Diablito.[^5][^4]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Official DNF percentages for Baked Potato and QSR stages.
- Detailed hazard list (exact km markers for El Diablito and other rough sectors) beyond high‑level route descriptions.

**Conflicting info:**

- Distances: Baked Potato referenced as 102 mi, 103 mi, and 165 km depending on route year (Fully Loaded variant) and source; vert quoted as “just under 1900 m” and “around 6000 ft,” which are consistent within error but vary by route year.[^2][^3][^5][^4]
