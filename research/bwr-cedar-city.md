# BWR CEDAR CITY (UTAH) - RAW RESEARCH DUMP

Generated: December 28, 2025

## OFFICIAL DATA

| Field | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Distance | Waffle ~127 mi / 6,500–6,700 ft (2024 shortened slightly), Wafer ~80 mi, Wanna ~40 mi, templated from classic 125 mi / 6,000 ft 75% dirt design [^1][^2][^3] | [^1][^2][^3] |
| Elevation | Original course ~6,000–6,500 ft climbing; 2024 cold‑weather route ~6,550 ft over 127 mi [^1][^4] | [^1][^4] |
| Location | Cedar City, Utah (start/finish near downtown/Frontier Homestead, into Iron County ranchland and foothills) [^5][^2][^3] | [^5][^2][^3] |
| Date (2025/2026) | Spring BWR stop (early April); 2024 race held April 6, 2024 with freezing temps and snow on run‑in, 2025 planned similar early‑April weekend [^6][^7][^8] | [^6][^7][^8] |
| Field size | Hundreds of starters; reports describe “riders from across the globe” and a deep North American pro field (Stetina, Gomez Villafañe, Roberge, etc.) [^5][^7][^8] | [^5][^7][^8] |
| Entry cost | Typical BWR tiered pricing; Waffle in the 200–300 USD range, Wafer/Wanna cheaper (exact year‑specific tiers on BWR reg page) [^3] | [^3] |
| Cutoff time | Multiple time checks; harsh weather in 2024 led to route shortening and time‑cut decisions on course [^7][^8] | [^7][^8] |
| Aid stations | Several fully stocked aid stations along Waffle/Wafer; riders describe being able to race 3.5 hours at 23 mph between key stops [^5][^9] | [^5][^9] |
| Registration type | Standard BWR online registration via belgianwaffleride.bike (Race Roster/partner) [^3] | [^3] |
| Website | https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/cedar-city-2020-course (course hub; main nav under “Utah”) [^3] | [^3] |

## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- BWR describes Cedar City as a gravel race with roughly 10 paved sectors and the majority on dirt, about 75% gravel/dirt vs 25% pavement on the classic 125‑mile route.[^2][^3]
- Slowtwitch calls the gravel “fast‑rolling, but also has some hidden treachery,” with wide open valleys, ranch roads, farm doubletrack, and “playground type sand” sectors that can wreck momentum.[^5][^10]

**Technical sections:**

- Source Endurance’s course musings emphasize “miles of playground type sand” and argue for at least 40 mm tires to stay on top of the sand and ruts.[^10]
- PureGravel’s recap describes “a steep, washboarded descent” after the highest point, hammering jaws and shoulders already tenderized by 110 miles of mostly gravel, which is where tired riders make mistakes.[^4]

**Notable climbs:**

- Rob Rides: “125 miles, 6k of climbing, starting at 5,600 ft,” with a “sandy and most challenging climb at mile 100” followed by a 20‑minute technical rocky section that ends within ~5 miles of the finish, i.e., you pay your dues very late.[^11][^2]
- BWR’s own notes compare Cedar City to San Diego with “half the climbing” but still enough long grinder climbs to split groups before the late sand/rock sectors.[^3][^9]

**Problem areas:**

- The “playground sand” sections are notorious; if you come in under‑tired or on narrow rubber, you grind to a halt or crash, and Source Endurance specifically warns about how that sand rides at race speed.[^10]
- That mile‑100 sandy/rocky climb and the subsequent washboarded descent have a reputation as the place where already shattered riders lose positions, crash, or cramp, because there’s essentially no recovery before the finish.[^4][^2][^11]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Pre‑race day had “snowing sideways”; race itself featured freezing temps, high winds, and snow on the run‑in; forecast kept swinging between snow and rain. [^6][^8] | Course was shortened; CyclingNews notes the race was cut due to freezing conditions, high winds, and snow before the final sectors, but Gomez Villafañe and Stetina still dominated. [^7] |
| 2023 | No big weather crisis reported; “most fun I’ve had in a gravel race in a long time” with tactical racing on a dry version of the course. [^12] | Race reports focus on crosswinds and high speeds rather than mud/precip; typical cold‑to‑mild spring high‑desert day. [^5][^12] |
| 2020 | Inaugural year described as “dry weather at elevation,” with demoralizing dust and sun; temps moderate but dry air and altitude made it feel harsher. [^13][^2] | First‑year riders remember the sand and washboard more than weather issues. [^13][^2] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- Early April at 5,600+ ft means below‑freezing starts are common, with the potential not to get above freezing until mid‑afternoon in bad years, or to warm into the 50s–60s F in good years.[^6][^8]

**Primary risk:**

- Extreme variability: snow, freezing wind, and rain in 2024, but dry, dusty conditions in 2020; either way, cold hands and windchill at start, then dehydration risk once sun and pace pick up.[^13][^8][^6]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Start around 5,600–6,000 ft, with much of the course riding between 5,500–7,000 ft on plateaus and ridges.[^2][^11]

## REDDIT DEEP DIVE

(There is not a big cluster of BWR Cedar City‑specific Reddit threads; most BWR Utah chatter is scattered and less detailed than blogs.)[^14][^10]

### r/gravelcycling threads:

- BWR Utah gets mentioned more generically alongside California and Kansas in “big bucket list events,” but without the kind of detailed course breakdown you see for Unbound or BWR CA.[^10]


### r/cycling / r/triathlon threads:

- Limited; most nuance on Cedar City’s sand and sector layout is in Source Endurance, Slowtwitch, and personal blogs rather than Reddit.[^5][^14][^10]


### r/Velo threads:

- None with meaningful detail surfaced for Cedar City specifically.


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

**Thread:** “Anybody doing BWR Cedar City?”
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/anybody-doing-bwr-cedar-city/85403[^14]
**Key quotes:**

- “This will be my first gravel race and I’m freaking excited! I’m doing the men’s Wafer riding a Canyon Grail AL with 40mm Continental Terra Trail.” – OP on setup.[^14]
- Replies stress bringing at least 40 mm tires for sand and being prepared for long fast road sectors where aero still matters, so you can’t go full MTB.[^9][^14]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ~0–40 | Early fast mixed sectors | ENVE notes ~23 mph average for first 3.5 hours; people burn matches trying to hold wheels in wind and on fast dirt, then pay later. [^9] |  |
| ~60–90 | Long exposed valleys and sand sectors | Sand and crosswinds cook legs and lower‑body stabilizers; under‑tired wheels knife into sand and cause crashes or walking. [^5][^10][^4] |  |
| ~100 | “Sandy and most challenging climb at mile 100” | Steep, sandy climb when you’re cracked; many report using every gear and still grinding, with cramps and walking common. [^2][^11] |  |
| ~100–120 | 20‑minute rocky/technical section after summit | PureGravel describes a steep, washboarded descent after the high point; this 20‑minute rocky sector shreds hands, shoulders, and focus after 110 miles. [^4][^11] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- The mile‑100 sandy climb leading straight into rocky/washboarded descending is the signature “soul‑crusher” that repeatedly appears in blogs and photo essays.[^11][^4][^2]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- Exact percentages aren’t published, but inaugural 2020 coverage and later reports make it clear Cedar City has a noticeable attrition rate, especially in years with heat, sand, or freezing wind—more than a typical fondo, less than an ultra‑epic like Unbound XL.[^8][^13][^4]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Burning too many matches in the first 3–4 hours of 23 mph pack racing on mixed surfaces, then imploding in the sand and late climbs.[^5][^9]
2. Sand and rocky sectors causing crashes, flats, or broken resolve near mile 100.[^4][^2][^11][^10]
3. Weather‑driven hypothermia risk in cold years; Source Endurance’s 2024 guide literally tells riders “don’t expect a warm up as it won’t get above freezing until sometime in the mid‑afternoon.”[^8]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Generally around later checkpoints after the big sandy climb and before the final technical sector when pace has slowed dramatically; in 2024 some riders were effectively cut when the course was shortened due to snow and high winds.[^7][^8]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- Source Endurance recommends ~40 mm tires to negotiate multiple miles of sand (“playground type sand”) and rocky washboard, calling out IRC Boken 40c as a good benchmark.[^10]
- ENVE and many race reports show pros on 38–42 mm gravel tires with fast center tread and more aggressive shoulders to balance speed on pavement and confidence in sand/rock.[^9][^5][^10]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Flats and rim strikes on the rocky, washboarded late descent, plus sand‑caused drivetain wear and chain drops when riders shift under load on the sandy climb.[^11][^4][^10]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Rob Rides mentions the late sandy climb as “demoralizing,” implying you want sub‑1:1 gearing if you’re not at pro level; many setup guides favor compact or 1x with 44–46T low gear.[^2][^10]
- ENVE’s “What worked \& what didn’t” notes that deeper aero wheels were great in the fast opening hours but that you still need enough low‑end for the late climbing under fatigue.[^9]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- Warmer gear in 2024 (Hannah Otto literally woke up to snowing sideways and wrote about last‑minute clothing decisions).[^6]
- Wider, more supple tires with good volume for sand and washboard instead of narrow “fast” gravel race tires.[^4][^10]
- More respect for the mile‑100 climb and the technical sector after it; several race reports read as “I wish I’d saved more matches for that part.”[^5][^2][^4]

Sources:[^6][^8][^2][^5][^10][^4][^9]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Cedar City Regional Airport (CDC) is in town but limited; most out‑of‑state racers fly to Las Vegas (LAS) or Salt Lake City (SLC) and drive a few hours.[^13][^5]

**Lodging:**

- Cedar City is a college gateway town (Southern Utah University, national parks), so lodging exists but can book up around race weekend; several reports mention needing to secure rooms well in advance.[^13][^5]

**Parking:**

- Start/finish in or near town with large parking fields; no significant complaints about parking logistics surfaced in race reports.[^11][^5]

**Packet pickup:**

- Standard BWR format: expo and packet pickup day before, with a big “waffle + beer” scene and tech partner booths; PureGravel/OBED recount the expo vibe in 2020.[^13][^4]

**Local tips:**

- Slowtwitch emphasizes the beauty of expansive southern Utah valleys but warns that the lack of shade and wind protection makes them feel endless when you’re cracked.[^5]
- Source Endurance tells riders to “dress like you’re skiing in the morning and racing in the afternoon” for the 2024 cold‑snap edition.[^8]

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Cedar City was introduced in 2020 as BWR’s first major gravel‑heavy expansion beyond San Diego, positioned as the “Belgian Waffle Ride: Cedar City, Utah” from launch.[^3][^13]

**Origin story:**

- Created to bring the BWR “quadrupel” style of mixed‑surface brutality to high‑desert Utah, with half the climbing of San Diego but more sand and gravel to keep the “unroad” identity intact.[^3][^5]

**How it's evolved:**

- Course has been tweaked year‑to‑year (Flavia Oliveria notes Cedar City’s course changes and credits organizers for smart adjustments) but the core identity of sand + late technical sections remains.[^16][^4]
- 2024 weather‑shortened edition proved organizers will shorten or alter the route if safety demands it.[^7][^8]

**How community talks about it:**

- Viewed as a real BWR, not a watered‑down satellite: slower technical sections and sand but still hours of 20+ mph racing and high‑end tactics.[^9][^5]
- Often recommended as a “tough but slightly more approachable than San Diego” BWR for people who want the full experience with a bit less total vert but still plenty of suffering.[^2][^10][^5]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared to BWR San Diego: less climbing but more pure gravel and sand, and similar level of technical riding and demoralizing late‑race features.[^3][^2]
- Compared to Unbound: shorter and less muddy (usually), but higher average speeds and more tactical due to BWR’s road‑race DNA.[^10][^5]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “It was time to do some real training or at least to look at some training plans to get to a level where an epic like the BWR wouldn’t break me.” – PureGravel rider.[^15]
2. “The course. 125 miles. 6k of climbing. 75% dirt. starting at 5,600 ft … technical riding and sand. dry weather at elevation. demoralizing.” – Rob Rides.[^2]
3. “Over the top, though, and the difficulty wasn’t over: a steep, washboarded descent followed, jarring jaws and shoulders tenderized by 110 miles of mostly gravel.” – PureGravel recap.[^4]
4. “Don’t expect a warm up as it won’t get above freezing until sometime in the mid‑afternoon.” – Source Endurance on 2024 BWR Utah.[^8]
5. “Last weekend at BWR Utah was the most fun I’ve had in a gravel race in a long time, and I committed to strict focus throughout the race.” – Adam Roberge.[^12]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “The day before BWR Cedar City, I looked out of the window and it was snowing sideways.” – Hannah Otto.[^6]
2. “We rode the first 3.5 hrs of the race at an average of around 23 mph, so having the deeper and more aerodynamic wheels was a real advantage.” – ENVE race report.[^9]
3. “At 6,000 ft above sea level. With a sandy and most challenging climb at mile 100. That leads you into a 20 min technical rocky section ending 5 miles from the finish.” – Rob Wessels photo essay.[^11]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do forums/videos recommend for prep?

- Train specifically for long, high‑speed mixed‑surface racing: lots of tempo and sweet‑spot work to handle 3–4 hours at 20–23 mph before the sand and climbs.[^12][^5][^9]
- Practice sand riding and technical descending under fatigue, ideally on 38–42 mm gravel tires, because late sand and washboard are where exhausted riders lose the plot.[^10][^4][^2]
- Prepare for cold starts and rapidly changing weather with layered clothing strategies and a fueling plan that still works with gloves and numb hands.[^6][^8]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact DNF percentages or full finisher counts by year.
- Precise 2026 route file and any further course tweaks beyond 2024 weather‑shortened version (need latest GPX from BWR reg portal).

**Conflicting info:**

- Distances quoted vary slightly (125 vs 127 miles, 6k vs 6.5k ft) due to course changes and the 2024 weather‑altered route.[^1][^4][^2]
