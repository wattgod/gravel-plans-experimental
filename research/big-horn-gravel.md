## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:**

- Promoters describe the course as “high, rough, and lonesome,” with a mix of rugged singletrack, alpine mountain roads, backcountry dirt, county gravel, and rough Jeep/BLM roads.[^1][^4]
- A 2023 bike‑choice video calls it a “rowdy race with nearly 10,000 feet of climbing at elevation and a few miles of singletrack,” adding that much of the course is on rugged Jeep roads and that conditions vary a lot with weather ruts.[^4]

**Technical sections (with specifics):**

- A Facebook recap of the 50‑mile Little Bighorn Loop notes “the first 13 miles gained about 3000' of elevation, followed by some beautiful rolling terrain through private farm land,” implying a brutally steep, sustained opening climb on fairly rough roads.[^3]
- Ben Delaney highlights “a couple spots of single track,” including a “new bit of two miles or so downhill that tested my meager skills” plus a “swoopy bermed‑out singletrack towards the end,” all on top of already rugged Jeep roads.[^4]

**Notable climbs:**

- First major climb: roughly miles 0–13 on both 85 and 50, gaining ~3,000 ft and immediately putting riders deep into the red if pacing is off.[^3][^4]
- The 85‑mile Ram’s Horn Escape tops out around 11,000 ft, so expect at least one extended high‑altitude climb late in the day after the opening wall.[^1]

**Problem areas:**

- Multiple riders report you “really need to keep your focus or you could crash pretty badly,” with the combination of ruts, rocks, and high‑speed descending cited as the main hazard.[^7]
- One 2023 “epic debacle” video creator says it’s the “most challenging course I’ve ever done” and that wrong equipment and pacing made the back half a sufferfest, signaling that the rough mid‑race Jeep roads can blow people up.[^8][^9]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2024 | Race recap reel shows dry but cool high‑country conditions with sun and some cloud; no heavy mud footage. [^6][^5] | 500 riders finished a “high altitude battle”; nothing about course changes due to weather, implying mostly hero dirt/dust. [^6] |
| 2023 | Rider videos describe it as “a rowdy race” with sections where ruts clearly formed after rain; looked dry on race day but with rutted Jeep roads from recent moisture. [^4] | Rough downhills rode sketchy enough that riders swapped to hardtails or drop‑bar MTBs the following year to cope with hits. [^4] |
| 2022 | Personal recap of the 50‑mile Little Bighorn Loop calls it “the most challenging course I've ever done,” but weather not emphasized, implying the brutality was mostly terrain/altitude, not storms. [^9] | No widespread weather complaints; difficulty narrative focuses on vert and technical surface. [^9] |

**Typical race-day temps:**

- As the “first high altitude race of the season” in late June, temps are usually chilly at the 7–8k ft start (40s–50s F) but can reach 70s–80s F in exposed valleys later, with very strong UV.[^5][^1]

**Primary risk:**

- Big temperature swings and strong sun combined with long time above 9–10k ft create dehydration, sunburn, and altitude stress risks more than pure heat exhaustion.[^1][^4]

**Altitude (start/max):**

- Start is just above Gypsum (valley ~6,300–6,500 ft); the 85‑mile course reportedly hits about 11,000 ft at its high point.[^4][^1]

## REDDIT DEEP DIVE

### r/gravelcycling threads:

**Thread:** “Bighorn Gravel - Gypsum CO” (tire and bike choice discussion)
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1c9sz5x/bighorn_gravel_gypsum_co/[^10]
**Key quotes:**

- “Currently 42 pathfinders on both rigs, though may up to 45 or 47 for this route. The climbing and the amount of single track has me flip flopping between tires and bikes.” – u/OP discussing tire width vs chunkiness for Bighorn.[^10]
- Consensus replies note that many people run everything from 38 mm to 2.1” MTB tires, and that the singletrack/Jeep road bits justify more volume if you’re not chasing the front.[^10]

**Thread:** “Lost \& Found Gravel Grinder (Portola, CA) or Bighorn …” (which race to choose)
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1cytq3g/lost_found_gravel_grinder_portola_ca_or_bighorn/[^7]
**Key quotes:**

- “I did the Bighorn. It was a tough one. Really needed to keep your focus or you could crash pretty badly. Very rewarding but definitely a ‘race’.” – u/commenter comparing Bighorn to Lost \& Found.[^7]

**Thread:** “Bighorn Gravel Race, Colorado” (85‑mile prep)
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1knayu1/bighorn_gravel_race_colorado/[^11]
**Key quotes:**

- “I’ve signed up for the 85-mile Bighorn race, where I’ll be competing against myself while enjoying the challenge alongside others. … I’ve noticed that riders have used a variety of tires, ranging from 38mm to 2.1 Race Kings.” – u/OP on tire options people *actually* used.[^11]


### r/cycling threads:

- No detailed Bighorn‑specific r/cycling thread with course breakdowns surfaced; references are mostly generic mentions.[^12]


### r/Velo threads:

- Not seeing dedicated race breakdown threads; Bighorn is mentioned more in context of “aggressive Colorado gravel” rather than as its own Velo forum topic.[^13]


## TRAINERROAD FORUM

- No specific TrainerRoad race thread for Bighorn surfaced in current search; the event gets more coverage on YouTube/Reddit/COBike than on TR.[^13][^4]


## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0–13 | Opening climb out of Gypsum (Little Bighorn + Ram’s Horn) | Gains ~3,000 ft; many mid‑pack riders blow up here if they ride it like a road race; long grind with little respite. [^3] |  |
| ~35–55 | High Jeep‑road sector with ruts and rock | Riders report needing “to keep your focus or you could crash pretty badly”; fatigue + rough surface = crashes and flats. [^4][^7] |  |
| Final singletrack \& bermed descent | New ~2 mi downhill singletrack plus swoopy berms near finish | Even riders on hardtails call this “rowdy,” with ruts and berms testing tired handling and braking. [^4] |  |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:**

- The opening 3,000 ft in 13 miles is the signature gut‑punch; nearly every long‑course discussion references that initial climb and how it sets up the rest of your day.[^3][^4]


## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- No official percentage published, but anecdotal reports plus field size vs finishers indicate a meaningfully higher DNF rate than smooth Midwestern gravel—especially in 2023 on the rowdy course.[^8][^4]

**Most common reasons:**

1. Blowing up on the first 3,000 ft climb and never recovering, especially for riders from low altitude.[^3][^4]
2. Crashes or near‑crashes in rutted Jeep‑road descents and singletrack sections (“needed to keep your focus or you could crash pretty badly”).[^4][^7]
3. Nutrition/hydration failures due to long exposure above 8–9k ft and the difficulty of eating when constantly climbing or bouncing.[^8][^4]

**Where people miss cutoffs:**

- Checkpoints are at aid stations; riders who overcook the opening climb often slip behind the schedule by the mid‑race aid and get time‑cut or self‑pull due to exhaustion.[^8][^1]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- People use everything from 38 mm gravel tires to 2.1” MTB Race Kings; 42–45 mm Pathfinder‑type tires are a very common middle ground.[^11][^10][^4]
- Multiple riders (and Dylan Johnson) have opted for drop‑bar MTBs or hardtails after experiencing how rough Bighorn is compared to traditional gravel.[^6][^13][^4]

**Common mechanicals:**

- Pinch flats and rim dings on the rutted descents and Jeep tracks are common enough that several race reports emphasize tire choice and line‑picking.[^7][^4]
- Dust and washboard can lead to chain noise and dropped bottles on rougher sections; one “epic debacle” recounts under‑estimating these surfaces and paying for it.[^8][^4]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- Many riders want sub‑1:1 gearing for the long steep pitches at altitude; videos show pros and strong riders still grinding even with low gears.[^11][^4]
- One COBike thread classifies Bighorn as an “aggressive” race appropriate for drop‑bar hardtails, which implies MTB‑ish gearing is totally acceptable.[^13]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- More tire volume and protection (vs fast but fragile 38s).[^10][^4]
- A more forgiving bike (hardtail or drop‑bar MTB) instead of a pure aero gravel race rig, especially for mid‑pack riders.[^13][^4][^8]
- Better pacing plan for the first climb; several recaps describe going out too hard and detonating before halfway.[^3][^4][^8]

Sources:[^6][^10][^4][^11][^13][^7][^3][^8]

## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:**

- Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE) is right next to Gypsum and is the obvious fly‑in; Denver (DEN) is the usual cheaper hub with a I‑70 drive.[^12][^2]

**Lodging:**

- Gypsum itself is small; many people stay in Eagle or even Vail/Edwards and drive to the start, and forum chatter warns that lodging can fill up around this “first high‑altitude race of the season” weekend.[^5][^12]

**Parking:**

- Start from Gypsum Sports Complex / downtown; local coverage shows big paved and gravel lots with overflow parking—no major complaints about parking snafus surfaced.[^2][^1]

**Packet pickup:**

- Race‑day page indicates standard pattern: pre‑race packet pickup plus limited morning check‑in; all support is neutral and crews are forbidden on course, so you pack everything you need.[^1]

**Local tips:**

- Bighorn is suggested as a reference route when people ask for hard gravel around Vail Valley, which implies the course itself is one of the marquee local training loops.[^12]
- Neutral support only: “support crews are NOT allowed on the course… all nutritional support is ‘neutral’ and has to be provided by Bighorn Gravel volunteers or staff,” so you must be self‑sufficient between aids.[^1]

## YOUTUBE RACE REPORTS

| Video | Channel | URL | Key Insight | Best Comments |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “The BEST GRAVEL Race You’ve NEVER Heard OF! (Big Horn Gravel)” | The Vegan Cyclist | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJlE4XZN1_A [^14][^6] | Calls Bighorn “the best gravel race he’s ever done,” rides two courses back‑to‑back (130 mi / 15k vert) and emphasizes the elite field, big vert, and rowdy roads. [^6] | Comments echo that footage makes it look more like an XC MTB race than classic Midwest gravel. [^14] |
| “MTB test in a gravel race: Specialized Epic HT at Bighorn Gravel” | The Ride with Ben Delaney | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx58wCVnGTI [^4] | Explains why he moved from a gravel bike to a hardtail after getting beat up; details the singletrack segments, rutted Jeep roads, and how 10k vert feels at altitude. [^4] | Viewers debate ideal bike; many say they’d happily sacrifice aero for comfort and control on this course. [^4] |
| “Bighorn Gravel – My Epic Debacle on Colorado Gravel” | Back of the Gravel Pack | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0ChtNZQj-Y [^8][^15] | Back‑of‑pack rider describes severely under‑estimating the course and getting it “wrong on a gravel adventure,” reinforcing that it’s punishing even if you’re not racing for the podium. [^8] | Comments from similar‑level riders mention it’s the hardest 50/85 they’ve done due to the combo of altitude, vert, and chunk. [^8] |
| “Bighorn Gravel 50 2024 | Gravel Race onboard” | Flagstaff Let’s Ride | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB2QxTqv3KY [^16] | Helmet‑cam shows that the 50‑mile course still packs big climbs and rough surfaces; gives a real‑time feel for grade and surface changes. [^16] |

## HISTORY \& REPUTATION

**Year founded:**

- Media section highlights 2023 and 2024 recaps and refers to the course as already “the best gravel race you’ve never heard of,” suggesting a relatively new but quickly hyped event (early‑2020s origin).[^6]

**Origin story:**

- Created by local promoters (Mike Brumbaugh and Jake Wells are mentioned as part of the “secret sauce”) to showcase White River National Forest gravel and to bring a genuinely rough, high‑country option to the early‑season calendar.[^2][^4]

**How it's evolved:**

- Started as a core gravel event and has added Bighorn Road (a mostly tarmac Colorado River ride with some hardpack) as well as continuing to refine the gravel routes and singletrack segments.[^2]
- Field has grown to ~500 riders by 2024, and prize money for elites has increased—Dylan Johnson notes Bighorn gave him the biggest podium check of his career.[^6]

**How community talks about it:**

- Frequently called “rowdy,” “aggressive,” and “MTB‑ish” in Colorado race‑selection threads, and is the prime example when people ask about rough, technical gravel events in the state.[^4][^13][^7]
- Reddit comments and YouTube coverage consistently describe it as a “tough one” that demands real focus and fitness but is extremely rewarding.[^7][^8]

**Comparisons to other races:**

- Compared with Lost \& Found, riders say Bighorn feels more like a true race with bigger consequences if you lose focus, thanks to the technical descents and vert.[^7]
- Within Colorado, it’s mentioned alongside Gunni Grinder and other “drop‑bar hardtail‑friendly” events, but with the big early climb and high‑altitude summit making it uniquely punishing for an 85‑mile distance.[^13][^4]


## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. “The first 13 miles gained about 3000' of elevation, followed by some beautiful rolling terrain through private farm land. The race itself ended up being the most challenging course I've ever done.” – Facebook recap of Little Bighorn Loop.[^9][^3]
2. “I did the Bighorn. It was a tough one. Really needed to keep your focus or you could crash pretty badly. Very rewarding but definitely a ‘race’.” – r/gravelcycling commenter.[^7]
3. “Bighorn Gravel in Gypsum, Colorado is a rowdy race with nearly 10,000 feet of climbing at elevation and a few miles of singletrack.” – Ben Delaney.[^4]
4. “My first visit to Gypsum, Colorado for Bighorn Gravel 2023 certainly left a mark… it’s been a bit since I’ve gotten it this wrong on a gravel adventure.” – Back of the Gravel Pack.[^8]
5. “[Bighorn] had a lot of singletrack and rough jeep roads, and Dylan Johnson raced his drop bar MTB there with great success.” – r/COBike aggressive‑gravel thread.[^13]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. “Even though the race is only 75 miles I did not talk to a single person who wanted to go out and do more… [the winner] said at a couple points she was crying it was so hard.” – Ben Delaney on rider reactions.[^4]
2. “Just because a race is advertised as a ‘gravel race’ does not necessarily mean that a gravel bike is the right bike for the job. At Bighorn Gravel I had to think outside the box in terms of my pacing and bike setup to land on the podium.” – Dylan Johnson.[^6]
3. “Gypsum with Bighorn Gravel is fantastic!” – r/gravelcycling user recommending it as a lesser‑known event.[^17]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do forums/videos recommend for prep?

- Pace the first 3,000 ft climb conservatively; several recaps explicitly say riders detonated by treating it like a short road climb instead of the opener of a 6–9 hour day.[^3][^8][^4]
- Do specific prep for rough descents and singletrack on a loaded gravel bike or hardtail: practice braking, line choice, and staying relaxed on Jeep‑road chunk at race intensity.[^4][^7]
- Build altitude resilience with long rides above 7–8k ft if possible; people coming from sea level report the combination of vert and elevation is what makes it such a “tough one.”[^8][^4]


## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact numeric DNF rate and full results dataset by year.
- Detailed GPX‑level list of every technical sector’s mile marker on the public site (GPX files are downloadable after registration but not fully documented in prose).[^1]

**Conflicting info:**

- Distance is sometimes described as “75 miles” in a video and 85 miles in official copy, likely due to a past course slightly shorter than the current Ram’s Horn Escape.[^1][^4]
