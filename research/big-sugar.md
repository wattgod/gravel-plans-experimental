## TERRAIN & SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS

**Gravel Type:**
- "Chunky and loose and sharp"
- Sharp-edged rocks (higher mechanical failure rate)
- Loose surface over hardpack
- Rut formation common
- Dust when dry

**Elevation Profile:**
- Not officially given elevation total
- "Punchy climbs" - short, steep (13%+ grade)
- Rolling terrain, not sustained climbing
- Multiple climb repetitions throughout
- Descents follow climbs (tactical)

**Technical Challenges:**
- 90° corners with descents: "Straight down into 90 degree turn at bottom"
- Dangerous transition points
- High crash risk at corners
- Requires precise bike handling
- Sharp rocks increase puncture/damage risk

**Specific Tough Sections:**
- "Suicide hill" at mile 21: Brutal reputation
- Mile 80+ exposed gravel stretch: 2-mile section at threshold, 9-10 mph pace
- October wind: "20+ mph gusts, brutal being exposed with no where to hide"

**Route Specifics:**
- Extends into Missouri (crosses state lines)
- Loops back to Bentonville start/finish
- 3 rest stops mentioned

## WEATHER & CONDITIONS (OCTOBER)

### Typical October Arkansas:
- Fall season (55-75°F typical)
- Early cool mornings, warmer afternoons
- Lower humidity than summer
- Occasional rain risk (early October can be wet)
- Wind exposure increases fatigue

### 2024 Race Conditions:
- Rain: Mile 20-60+ had rain
- Made course "slog" - heavy/muddy in spots
- Created mechanical challenges
- Slower paces required
- Mud accumulation in drivetrain

## CRASH DATA & MECHANICAL FAILURES

### Crash Frequency:
- "Saw lots of wounds and bandages at finish"
- 90° corner descents are crash magnets
- Sharp gravel increases injury severity
- "Treacherous descents" documented
- First-timer report: Expected crashes part of race

### Mechanical Failures:
- Sharp rocks cause flats (higher rate than Unbound)
- Loose surface catches spokes/derailleurs
- 2024 rain made mud accumulation worse
- Chain/drivetrain clogging possible
- Spoke/rim damage from rocks

### DNF/Injury Risk:
- No specific DNF rates found
- Crash injuries appear significant
- Remote sections = delayed medical response
- Early-race crashes ("Suicide hill" mile 21) = long suffering

## RACE CHARACTER & COMMUNITY

### Bentonville Connection:
- Walmart trails culture (mountain bike infrastructure hub)
- NWA (Northwest Arkansas) gravel scene hub
- Downtown start/finish atmosphere
- Growing regional gravel community
- "Bentonville is becoming a gravel destination"

### Emerging Status:
- Big Sugar relatively newer to Tier 1 status
- Less media coverage than Unbound/Mid South
- Part of growing Ozark racing culture
- Less sponsorship/professional infrastructure

## TERRAIN COMPARISON TO OTHER TIER 1 RACES

### vs Unbound Gravel (200mi Kansas):
- Both have sharp rocks
- Big Sugar: Much shorter, more intense per mile
- Unbound: Longer duration, different rock type
- Big Sugar: More technical climbing
- Unbound: More rolling

### vs Mid South (100mi Oklahoma):
- Big Sugar: Sharper gravel, more technical
- Mid South: Clay/red dirt, less chunky
- Big Sugar: More climbing
- Mid South: More festival atmosphere
- Big Sugar: More crash-prone

### vs SBT GRVL (116mi Colorado):
- Big Sugar: Lower elevation (advantage)
- SBT: More climbing gradients
- Big Sugar: Less technical singletrack
- SBT: Higher altitude challenge
- Big Sugar: More familiar terrain

### vs BWR California (119mi):
- Big Sugar: More gravel-focused
- BWR: More mixed terrain/singletrack
- Big Sugar: Less technical (no mandatory singletrack)
- BWR: More road sections
- Both: High crash rate, bike handling critical

## LOGISTICS & LOCATION

### Bentonville, Arkansas:
- Northwest Arkansas (NWA) region hub
- Growing outdoor recreation town
- Walmart headquarters = local infrastructure
- Mountain biking trails = cycling community
- Tourist amenities improving

### Nearby Cities:
- Fayetteville (college town, 10 miles)
- Rogers (commercial hub)
- Rogers-Fort Smith Airport (XNA) = air access

### Lodging:
- Hotels in Bentonville
- Airbnb/VRBO (college town + tourist destination)
- Camping options at nearby parks
- Crystal Bridges Museum nearby

## EQUIPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Tire Strategy:
- Wider tires (44-50mm) for loose/sharp gravel
- Knobby tread beneficial (not pure slick)
- File tread acceptable
- Lower pressure: 28-32 PSI (absorb sharp rocks, traction)
- Consider tire inserts (protect rims)

### Bike Setup:
- Strong frame (durability > speed)
- Robust wheels (durability > aero)
- Good brakes (hydraulic disc for long descents)
- Comfortable geometry (fatigue + technical = crash risk)

### Mechanical Prep:
- Extra spokes (higher failure rate)
- Spare derailleur hanger (sharp rocks bend)
- Extra sealant (higher flat rate expected)
- Chain lube (for potential mud/dust)
- Brake pads (long descents, fade risk)
