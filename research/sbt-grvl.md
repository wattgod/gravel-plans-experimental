## 2025 CRITICAL FORMAT CHANGE

**What Changed:**
- Old Format: Point-to-point or multi-loop pretzel routes
- New Format: 3-lap circuit race (37-mile lap x3)
- Saturday Aug 9: Non-competitive gravel ride (no official race)
- Sunday Aug 10: Official race starts

**Why The Change:**
- Local law enforcement: "Can't stage 3,000 rider race on open roads anymore"
- Permit/land conflicts forced redesign
- Wildfire proximity concerns
- Calendar conflict: Oregon Trail Gravel Grinder + BWR Montana

**2025 Winner:**
- Brennan Wertz: 8:09 finish, 23.67 mph average
- **FASTEST 100+ mile gravel race ever recorded**

## ALTITUDE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Physiology:
- ~1% power reduction per 1,000 feet elevation gain
- At 7,000 ft = ~7% FTP loss from sea level
- At 10,000 ft = ~10% FTP loss

### Non-Acclimatized Riders (Sea Level to 7,000+ ft):
- Highest heart rate zone (compensating for lower O2)
- Fastest lactate threshold
- Poor recovery between efforts
- Sleep disruption night before race

### Acclimatized (2+ weeks):
- Better adaptation but still 5-7% power loss
- Red blood cell production increases (takes weeks)
- Better sleep, fewer headaches
- Still 2-3% slower than sea level equivalent

### Pro Recommendation:
"Judicious with matches early, high altitude limits recovery" - FasCat Coaching

### Temperature Impact:
- Chilly AM start
- Warms fast during race
- Stays hot through day (105°F+ heat reported)
- High noon sun intensity

## TERRAIN & SURFACE

**Circuit Course (2025):**
- 37-mile lap x3 = ~111 miles
- Mild grades: 3-4% mostly
- "Beautiful" terrain
- Mixed dirt/pavement
- Scenic Rocky Mountain views
- No extreme technical sections

## EQUIPMENT & LOGISTICS NOTES

### Tire/Hydration Issues:
- Side-load bottle cages = lose bottles on washboard
- Hydration critical (high altitude + heat)
- More fluids needed than sea level races

## WEATHER PATTERNS

### August in Steamboat Springs:
- Afternoon thunderstorms possible
- Cool mornings, hot afternoons
- Rapid weather changes at altitude
- Lightning exposure (mountain afternoon storms)
- Wildfire smoke possible

## GAPS & UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**
- Exact founding year of SBT GRVL
- Amy Charity biographical details
- Historical DNF rates
- Specific mile markers for technical sections
- Detailed race reports from before 2025
- Prize money/entry costs
- Prior year (2024) finish times
- Will circuit format be permanent?
