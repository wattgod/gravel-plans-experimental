## TERRAIN \& SURFACE

**Surface breakdown:** 98% gravel, 2% pavement[^2]

**Technical sections:**

- Mile 28: "Extremely rough double track" - first major selection point, front pack of 1,100 drops to <50 riders[^9]
- Mile 40 Divide Road: "Minimally maintained, rutted and muddy stretch infamous for derailing races" - where winning moves often happen[^1]
- Mile 42+: "Technical, bumpy gravel" returns on North Course[^3]
- Miles 30-37: Cattle country - "chunky, rutted, cow pie laden" gravel. "3-5 folks on the side fixing flat at every descent"[^10]
- Little Egypt section (mile 104): "Rugged terrain" makes final selection, notorious for sharp rocks[^11]
- Prairie View Road: "The rollers" - must clear before Alma[^3]

**Notable climbs:**

- Miles 40-50 around Eskridge: "Punchy series of climbs"[^9]
- Mile 59: "BE-YOTCH" climb - 14-17% grade, ~3 minutes, switchback[^10]
- Texaco Hill (South Course): "Low, slow, 8 mile grind up 2-4% grades"[^10]
- Miles 70-88: "Gradual climbing" on northernmost section[^3]

**Problem areas:**

- **Divide Road (Mile 40):** Mud/ruts after rain, always rough
- **Miles 12-18 (2023 mud year):** "4 miles of peanut butter mud" - forced 1.5+ hour walk for most[^12]
- **Mile 152 and 171:** "High mud potential zones"[^13]
- **Flint rock everywhere:** "Razor-sharp rocks slice easily through gravel tyres" - constant flat risk[^14]

Sources:[^1][^13][^12][^2][^11][^14][^9][^10][^3]

## WEATHER HISTORY

| Year | Conditions | What Happened |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2025 | Wed rain (1+ inch), Saturday 80°F/blue skies | Dried out by race day, more heat/dust than mud. Cameron Jones set course record 8:37:09[^1][^11] |
| 2024 | Pre-race rain, Saturday 80°F/blue skies | Dried conditions, record-breaking fast times despite North Course[^11][^15] |
| 2023 | Heavy rain, mid-race thunderstorm, lightning, hail, wind | THE MUD DISASTER: 23% DNF rate (910 riders). Mile 12-18 = 4 miles walking. "45 mph crosswind hailstorm at mile 160"[^12][^16][^17] |
| 2022 | Rainy, river flooding, heavy rain | Parts of XL/200 re-routed. Deep mud chunks. Record times DESPITE conditions. Ivar Slik won 9:43:13[^18][^19] |
| 2021 | Heat, low 90s°F | North Course. 19% DNF rate similar to 2023. "Chills and goosebumps at mile 70 = bad heat sign"[^16][^20] |

**Typical race-day temps:** Pre-dawn chilly → 80-95°F mid-day[^21][^20]

**Primary risk:** Heat (most common), thunderstorms (can develop mid-race), mud (if rain within 48 hrs), wind, lightning

**Altitude (start/max):** Start ~1,100-1,200 ft / Max ~1,500 ft - not significant factor

**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/gravelcycling/comments/1d8dvkf/unbound_200_my_experience_pacing_strategy_tips/
**Key quotes:**

- "Mentally, I had marked Mile 28 as the first important point on the course, and I surged to make sure I led the entire pack. This extremely rough double track was much easier to take being on the front, and I applied a lot of pressure right away. Coming out of this section, I assume the entire pack of 1,100 riders was down to fewer than 50." - u/reddit winner (10:13 finish, age group win)
- "Coming out of a corner, I ended up with a small gap, and I pushed on... I secured the age group win and fell short just five minutes of the overall win"
- Setup: Lauf Seigla suspension fork, SRAM Red with XX1 10-52 Eagle cassette, 46t front, Continental Race Kings 2.2 (56mm)

**Key quotes:**

- "After that, we passed some cattle grates into open range with a lot of cattle. The gravel went from smooth to chunky, rutted, and cow pie laden. At every descent and divet, or low spot, it felt like there was 3-5 folks on the side of the road fixing a flat." - u/reddit_racer
- "This was probably the roughest section of the whole race (this area and the lead up to texaco hill climb)"
- "The texaco hill climb section was just a low, slow, 8 mile grind up some mild 2-4% grades"
- "There was another climb, the 'BE-YOTCH' around mile 59, it was a steep little switchback but maybe 3 minutes long. I think it touched 14-17%. I saw a few folks walking."

**Thread:** "Unbound Gravel 2025"
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/unbound-gravel-2025/97735
**Key quotes:**

- "Knock on wood and all that, I think I've just been very lucky but I'm also super careful on line choice and burn a bunch of energy allowing gaps to form when the road gets rough. But I've had to stop and plug tires on about ~30% of the pre-rides I've done in the area and I'm even more careful during pre-rides since I'm often alone and riding much slower." - Page 8
- "The rest of the race was very enjoyable…but stressful. 'Am I going too hard, am I eating / drinking enough, should I get on that wheel, should I let this wheel go, etc' But it was challenging and that was what I signed up for and I really enjoyed the challenge." - Page 22
- "The 100 mile option is the most difficult to get into, even though the 200 remains the 'marquee' event of the weekend."

**Thread:** "Unbound gravel race recap" (2021)
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/unbound-gravel-race-recap/53441
**Key quotes:**

- "Regarding tire pressure, at 185lb/84kg I'm running 40psi in my 43c (which measure 45mm) Gravel Kings and find that is a perfect amount of pressure for gravel and hard pack." - Page 15

**Thread:** "Unbound Gravel 2023"
**URL:** https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/unbound-gravel-2023/78142?page=55

## SUFFERING ZONES (specific locations where people break)

| Mile | Location/Section | What Happens | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 12-18 | Mud section (2023) | "4 miles of peanut butter mud" - forced walking/running, 1.5+ hour delay, mechanical carnage | [^12][^16] |
| 28 | Rough double track | First major selection - 1,100 riders → <50. "Extremely rough," front position critical | [^9] |
| 30-37 | Cattle country | Chunky/rutted gravel, constant flats. "3-5 folks fixing flat at every descent" | [^10] |
| 40 | Divide Road | "Minimally maintained, rutted and muddy stretch infamous for derailing races." Where elites attack | [^1][^9] |
| 40-50 | Eskridge climbs | "Punchy series of climbs" - heavier riders struggle | [^9] |
| 59 | BE-YOTCH climb | 14-17% switchback, ~3 minutes, people walking | [^10] |
| 70 | Alma checkpoint | Aid station chaos. "Felt like chaos, sounded like chaos, total sensory overload" | [^22] |
| 70-88 | Northern section | Gradual climbing section, exposure | [^3] |
| 104 | Little Egypt Road | "Rugged terrain" makes final selection in elite races. Sharp rocks, high-speed danger | [^11] |
| 148 | Council Grove | Second checkpoint where 100-milers merge with 200-milers = crowded, chaotic | [^22] |
| 152, 171 | Potential mud zones | "High potential for mud, very tricky sections" | [^13] |
| 160 | Exposed section | 2023: "45 mph crosswind hailstorm" forced riders to shelter in ditches | [^23] |
| Final 10 | Wind corners | "Many 90 degree corners where wind changes from crosswind to headwind" - tactical | [^24] |

**The ONE section everyone mentions:** Divide Road (Mile 40) - makes or breaks races

## DNF \& FAILURE DATA

**DNF rate:**

- 2023: 23% (910 riders DNF'd, 505 from 200-mile amateur alone) = 550% increase over 2022[^16]
- 2021: 19% (North Course, similar to 2023)[^16]
- 2022: Much lower (South Course, despite mud and flooding)
- 2024: Lower than 2023, but still "large number unable to finish"[^15]

**Most common reasons:**

1. **Mud-related mechanicals** (2023) - Broken derailleurs, chains clogged, wheels unable to spin[^12][^16]
2. **Derailleur destruction** - Broken spokes, mud/rocks in cage[^25][^26][^12]
3. **Flats/tire failures** - Sharp flint rock epidemic[^27][^28][^10]
4. **Heat exhaustion** - Stomach problems, inability to eat/drink[^29][^21]
5. **Crashes** - Technical sections, aid station chaos, rider pileups[^30][^11]
6. **Cutoff time misses** - Getting behind pace, especially after mechanicals[^22]

**Where people miss cutoffs:** Mostly after major mechanicals in first 70 miles or heat issues second half

**Notable DNFs 2025:**

- Emily Newsom[^31]
- Anna Yamauchi[^31]
- Klara Sofie Skovgård Hansen (crash, fractured/dislocated shoulder, "took 2 hours for ambulance")[^30]
- Sofia Gomez Villafañe (front flat derailed race)[^11]

**2023 Specific:**

- Paige Onweller: Mechanical at mile 20, couldn't pedal past 20 miles[^16]
- Multiple riders: "I sat at the cattle pens waiting for pickup with 7 other riders. There were many broken derailleurs and many battered bodies"[^12]


## EQUIPMENT INTEL

**Tire consensus:**

- **WINNING CHOICE 2025:** Schwalbe G-One RX/RS combo
    - Cameron Jones (1st): 50mm G-One RS front + 45mm G-One RX rear[^32]
    - Simon Pellaud (2nd): Thunder Burt 2.10 MTB tire front + 45mm G-One RS rear[^32]
- **Local shop (Merchant Cycles) recommends:** IRC Boken Doublecross OR Maxxis Ramblers 60 TPI SilkShield[^33]
- **Podium finisher favorite:** WTB Resolute 42mm (upgrading to 50mm for durability)[^28]
- **Width trend:** 50mm+ winning. "More and more people agree that the widest tire will be the fastest on gravel"[^34]

**Tire inserts:**

- Cameron Jones used Tannus Tubeless Lite: "Invisible, you don't feel them" but "saved me early race"[^35]
- Brendan Johnston (5th): Tannus Lite front + Tannus Gravel rear[^35]
- Karolina Migon (1st women): NO inserts after 2024 issues - gamble paid off[^32]

**Common mechanicals:**

1. **Derailleur destruction** - "Broken spoke went into rear derailleur, destroying it"[^25]
2. **Mud clogging** - "Once rear derailleur cage \& pulleys loads up with mud, rocks, grass, the chain can't pass through"[^26]
3. **Flats** - Constant issue. "30% of pre-rides result in plugging tires"[^36]
4. **Bottle ejection** - Rough terrain shakes bottles loose[^9]

**Gear ratio debates:**

- **2x WON 2025:** "Gravel might love 1x groupsets, but this year's Unbound results told a different story: Shimano and 2x drivetrains dominated the top step"[^32]
- **1x advantages:** Lighter, simpler, better in mud, no dropped chains, wider tire clearance[^37]
- **2x advantages:** Smaller gear jumps, better cadence optimization on flat Unbound course[^38][^37][^32]
- Lauren Zoerner: "I am a TTer at heart. We set my Canyon Grail up just like my TT bike... 2x Shimano GRX Di2"[^32]

**What people wish they'd brought:**

- Paint stirrer for mud (2023 lesson)[^23][^12]
- Extra sealant[^23]
- Gorilla tape wrapped on pump[^25]
- Spare derailleur (borrow from MTB)[^25]
- Chain breaker multitool (for singlespeed conversion)[^25]
- More food than you think[^39][^22]


## LOGISTICS

**Nearest airport:** Kansas City International (MCI) - ~120 miles, 2 hours drive[^40]

**Lodging:**

- BOOK EARLY - "Hotels taking names for waiting lists since most people book their rooms again for following year when they check out"[^41]
- **Official partner:** HotelPlanner (special rates)

- Historic Granada Theatre = start/finish landmark
- Commercial Street = main race corridor
- Merchant Cycles (local shop) = good for last-minute tire advice[^33]
- Highland Hill = final approach to finish[^2]

- Founded by Jim Cummins and Joel Dyke
- "We wanted the event to exist so that we could ride it. We knew that if we didn't create it, most likely nobody else would."[^14]
- First race: 34-36 participants
- Inspired by Flint Hills Death Ride (1993-2010) and Trans Iowa (2005+)
- Original required equipment: COMPASS for navigation
- Single checkpoint midway, primarily self-sufficient[^45]

**How it's evolved:**

- **2010:** Joel Dyke left, Kristi Mohn joined as partner
- **2018:** Life Time acquired event
- **2020:** Name change Dirty Kanza → Unbound Gravel (controversy over indigenous name, Jim Cummins departed)
- **Growth:** 36 starters → nearly 5,000 across all distances

## "WHAT I WISH I KNEW" - Direct Quotes

1. **NUTRITION IS EVERYTHING:**
"Unbound is just an eating contest so if you can keep eating then you're probably pretty good especially later on in the race" - youtube.com/watch?v=R5ewUUY6MlQ
2. **DON'T PANIC AT AID STATIONS:**
"In 2024 she said she 'panicked' at the first aid station when she realised everyone was going through so fast and she lost her focus, forgetting to take all her food from a table. 'So I started riding, panicking because the group was going ahead and I had to go back. You have to have nutrition at Unbound.'" - Paige Onweller[^22]
3. **CONSERVATIVE EQUIPMENT > MARGINAL GAINS:**
"For sure just being more conservative with equipment selection. When reflecting on last year and races gone awry, it was typically due to a crash or other issue that maybe could have been avoided if I had better control of my bike. I ran full slicks a lot last year... Even if knobby-er tires cost you two watts or whatever, it's worth not hitting the deck or flatting, and you're bound to have dozens of these little scares over the course of a 200 mile race." - Ventum Racing[^23]
4. **BRING A PAINT STIRRER (IF MUD):**
"I didn't bring a paint stirrer (dumb, so dumb), so I had to dig in the bushes for a stick to scrape my bike clean" - 2023 mud survivor[^12]
5. **EXPECT MULTIPLE 'DARK MOMENTS':**
"Everyone feels this, and it usually goes away if you wait long enough. Good endurance racers are good because they push through the darkness until they experience a second wind. During a super long race, they might go through this multiple times. I'll experience a third or fourth wind over a 12+ hour day at UNBOUND." - obedbikes.com/blogs[^39]
6. **DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF:**
"Don't sweat the small stuff. Walking around the expo and sizing up everyone elses gear can psyche you out and make you question everything. Just own your prep, embrace the day, and trust yourself to do your best." - Ventum Racing[^23]
7. **TIRE WORRIES WILL SLOW YOU DOWN:**
"The two biggest impacts were a) worrying about tires and b) bike handling slowdown, I would regularly get passed by people as I slowed down to pick careful lines" - First timer Reddit[^47]
8. **AID STATIONS ARE CHAOS:**
"It felt like chaos, sounded like chaos and was a total sensory overload. People were yelling at riders, music was blasting from every tent and my adrenaline was absolutely through the roof" - Lauren De Crescenzo[^22]
9. **CARRY CHAIN BREAKER:**
"Chain breakers add a bit of weight, but they can save your race if you snap your chain or destroy your rear derailleur. You can cut the chain and reconnect it with a quick link to create a singlespeed setup" - theproscloset.com[^25]
10. **KNOW YOUR WHY:**
"Ultra events are heavily tied to like an emotional response so I encourage everyone to ask themselves why are you doing this why are you out there why are you going to push your body past what it's ever been pushed past before if you can answer that why then you're more likely to refocus in some of the tougher moments" - youtube.com/watch?v=R5ewUUY6MlQ[^48]

## RAW QUOTES GOLDMINE (the brutal/funny/honest ones)

1. **THE MUD PIT FROM HELL:**
"The lowest point for me in all my years of racing Unbound was last year, 2023, in the depths of the mud pit at mile 11. My bike got stuck six times, and six times I had to dig out my tires using my fingers and a paint stick. After the sixth, I found a puddle in the middle of the road, gave my bike a full bath, shouldered it, and walked the remaining 5 miles until the road turned back to gravel... It didn't help that I got cursed at multiple times by other riders trying to pass me as I trudged down the middle of the road." - ventumracing.com[^23]
2. **SHELTERING FROM HAILSTORM IN A DITCH:**
"When a 45 mph crosswind hailstorm at mile 160 convinced me that sheltering in a ditch was the most prudent course of action" - ventumracing.com[^23]
3. **STOMACH STOPPED WORKING:**
"Eating and drinking were hard. I had everything on me, but my stomach just stopped absorbing. Still… it was one of the best battles I've had on a bike." - Lachlan Morton[^29]
4. **THE DERAILLEUR DEATH:**
"I heard a loud snap, and my derailleur went crashing into the cassette, instantly bringing me to a stop. The spoke had done more damage than I initially thought. My derailleur's inner pulley cage was broken, and the upper pulley was nowhere to be seen. The chain was twisted up around it all. The whole thing was mangled beyond repair." - theproscloset.com[^12]
5. **HURRICANE CONDITIONS:**
"Lightning, heavy rain, and wind gusts like I never seen before. I almost get thrown out of the road by a strong wind gust. This keeps getting worse. Am I riding in a hurricane?" - nordictrailblazer.cc[^17]
6. **PEANUT BUTTER MUD:**
"12 miles in, we faced the slowest, most heinous stretch of mud that I've ever experienced. It made last year's mud bogs seem easy in comparison. Riders were forced to dismount and hike nearly 4 miles. Some tried to ride in short bursts, but the peanut buttery mud would clog their bikes up quickly." - theproscloset.com[^12]
7. **THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE:**
"When Unbound last went north in 2021, a finishing time of 12 hours would have put you in 21st overall! It really shows how much faster Unbound has gotten and how stacked the field is now." - theproscloset.com[^49]
8. **EATING CONTEST REALITY:**
"That is the \#1 problem most riders will have. Eat early and often. Choose fuel that you can reliably get down in the heat after many hours." - Facebook advice thread[^50]
9. **TEAM TACTICS DON'T EXIST:**
"I don't think I've ever seen chase groups cooperate in a gravel race. It could be because it's largely an independent race and not a team race." - Reddit r/Velo[^51]
10. **THE FLINT HILLS TRUTH:**
"The abundant flint rock, or chert, that covers many gravel roads was shaped into arrowheads and other tools by the region's indigenous peoples. Today, these razor-sharp rocks slice easily through gravel tyres, so plan accordingly." - bikeradar.com[^14]

## TRAINING ADVICE FOUND

What do forums/videos recommend for prep?

**VOLUME:**

- "You don't have to ride 350 miles to train, but it's crucial to enter that zone of deep discomfort and uncertainty to know how your body will respond" - salsacycles.com[^52]
- "I pushed myself to go farther than I wanted on training rides. I would ride 100 miles and end up back at my house, but instead of calling it a day (even if I felt terrible) I would force myself to go back out for another hour or two." - salsacycles.com[^52]

**SPECIFICITY:**

- "I loaded up my bike as if I were racing and then pushed myself to ride all day without relying on c-stores" - XL finisher[^52]
- "Do what you need to do to get used to and feel good about gas station eating" - XL finisher[^52]

**PACING DISCIPLINE:**

- "Being a well-studied Dylan Johnson follower, I know this race is all about pacing, and my long endurance power is something I can rely on; I just had to make sure I wouldn't blow up." - 10:13 finisher[^9]
- "I tried positioning myself at the front on every climb and slowly drifting towards the back so as not to have to surge my power" - 10:13 finisher[^9]

**HEAT ACCLIMATION:**

- "The heat was definitely a factor, with temperatures in the low 90s. My heat acclimation leading up to Unbound Gravel was subpar" - pearlizumi.com[^20]
- Train in similar conditions or overdress to simulate heat

**MENTAL PREP:**

- "Ask yourself why are you doing this why are you out there... if you can answer that why then you're more likely to refocus in some of the tougher moments" - YouTube[^48]

## GAPS \& UNCERTAINTIES

**Couldn't find/verify:**

- Exact 2026 race date (typically first Saturday in June, but not yet announced)
- Precise cutoff times for intermediate checkpoints (only final cutoff 3:07 AM confirmed)
- Detailed breakdown of DNF reasons by percentage (only total 23% for 2023)
- Official entry cost (Life Time Grand Prix structure, lottery-based)
- Complete list of course records for all years

**Conflicting info:**

- First race participant count: Some sources say 34, others say 36
- Exact course elevation: Ranges from "10,000+ feet" to "11,800 feet" depending on year/course variation
- Tire pressure recommendations: Wide variance (18-49 PSI depending on rider weight, tire width, risk tolerance)
- Suspension fork benefit: Some top finishers use it (Rob Britton), most don't - personal preference vs competitive advantage unclear
