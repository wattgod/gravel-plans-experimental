# UNBOUND 200 RESEARCH BRIEF
## Gravel God Landing Page Data

### THE ANGLE
The Super Bowl of gravel. 200 miles of Kansas flint that has ended more races via derailleur destruction than any other event in the sport. This isn't about whether you're fast enough. It's about whether your equipment survives long enough for your fitness to matter.

### STRATEGIC VALUE
- **Competition:** High - TrainingPeaks, TrainerRoad have generic plans. Nobody addresses the mechanical survival reality.
- **Market Opportunity:** Flagship race, maximum search volume, defines gravel racing credibility
- **Protocol Fit:** Heat + Durability + Fueling (Standard protocols insufficient)

### VITAL STATISTICS
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Distance | 202.4 miles (varies by year) |
| Elevation | 10,000-11,800 ft (North Course higher) |
| Location | Emporia, Kansas (Flint Hills) |
| Date | First Saturday in June (2025: May 31) |
| Field Size | ~1,077 starters (200-mile) |
| Entry Cost | Lottery system (extremely competitive) |
| Cutoff | ~20.5 hours (3:07 AM from 6:30 AM start) |
| Aid Stations | 2 checkpoints (Mile 70, 148) + 2 water oases (Mile 40, 112) |

### TERRAIN PROFILE
- **Primary Surface:** Sharp flint gravel, razor rocks, unmaintained dirt
- **Technical Rating:** 3/5 - Bike handling matters but not MTB territory
- **Signature Features:**
  - Divide Road (Mile 40): Rutted, muddy, race-defining
  - Cattle country (Miles 30-37): Chunky, rutted, cow pie laden
  - Little Egypt (Mile 104): Sharp rocks, final selection point
  - "BE-YOTCH" climb (Mile 59): 14-17% switchback

### CLIMATE REALITY
- **Conditions:** Pre-dawn chill → 80-95°F mid-day. Thunderstorms develop mid-race.
- **Primary Challenge:** Heat (most common), followed by mud if rain within 48 hours
- **Historical Extremes:** 2023 = hailstorm, 45 mph crosswinds, peanut butter mud. 2021 = low 90s devastation.

## GRAVEL GOD RATINGS - COURSE PROFILE (RADAR CHART)

| Category | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Logistics** | 2/5 | Kansas City airport 2 hours away. Lodging in Emporia books a year out - hotels take waiting lists at checkout. Not remote, just limited capacity. Expand search to surrounding towns. |
| **Length** | 5/5 | 200+ miles. Elite finishers: 8-10 hours. Mid-pack: 12-16 hours. Back markers ride into darkness, finish near 3 AM. This is ultra territory. |
| **Technicality** | 3/5 | Not MTB, but bike handling separates finishers from DNFs. Divide Road's ruts, cattle country's chunky gravel, Little Egypt's sharp rocks. "I would regularly get passed by people as I slowed down to pick careful lines." |
| **Elevation** | 3/5 | 10,000-11,800 ft total climbing. Rolling, punchy, relentless - not big mountain climbing but never flat. "Texaco Hill was just a low, slow, 8-mile grind up mild 2-4% grades." The accumulation kills you. |
| **Climate** | 4/5 | Heat is the variable that "scares the shit out of" race directors. Low 90s common. 2023: lightning, hail, 45 mph crosswinds. "When the real feel is over 100, the temperature is crushing." Thunderstorms develop mid-race without warning. |
| **Altitude** | 1/5 | Start ~1,100 ft, max ~1,500 ft. Altitude is irrelevant. Sea level athletes have no acclimatization concerns. |
| **Adventure** | 4/5 | The race that defines American gravel. Flint Hills are genuinely beautiful - vast prairie, historic cattle country, indigenous history in the rocks themselves. "Grueling and beautiful." Worth traveling for the experience alone. |

**Course Profile Score:** 22/35

## WHY IT MATTERS: EDITORIAL JUDGMENT

| Category | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Prestige** | 5/5 | THE gravel race. "Super Bowl of cycling." "The most important gravel race in the world." If you want credibility in gravel, you finish Unbound. Everything else is regional. |

**Verdict:** Icon

**Summary:** Unbound isn't the hardest gravel race (Big Sugar's Ozark rock gardens are more technical, Leadville's altitude more punishing). But it's the one that matters. The field depth, the history, the cultural weight - this is where gravel racing proves itself. The Flint Hills don't negotiate.

**Strengths:**
- Defines the sport. Finishing means something.
- Field quality unmatched - you're racing against the best
- Infrastructure is dialed after 19 years
- The expo is "becoming the Sea Otter of gravel"

**Weaknesses:**
- Lottery entry is brutal - 100-mile harder to get into than 200
- Lodging nightmare - book a year ahead or stay in Topeka
- Course favors survivors over racers - mechanicals end more dreams than fitness
- Heat can turn it from race to survival exercise

**Bottom Line:** If you're serious about gravel, you need to do this race. Just don't expect your FTP to save you when your derailleur explodes at mile 40.

**Overall Score:** 88/100

### COURSE NARRATIVE

**Character:** Unbound rewards consistency over heroics. The athlete who rides clean, eats early, and changes lines to avoid the sharp stuff beats the athlete with 20 more watts who destroyed their derailleur chasing a gap.

**Suffering Zones:**
1. **Mile 28** - Rough double track. "First major selection point, front pack of 1,100 drops to <50 riders." Position matters.
2. **Mile 40 - Divide Road** - "Minimally maintained, rutted and muddy stretch infamous for derailing races." Where winning moves happen. Where mechanicals end races.
3. **Miles 30-37 - Cattle Country** - "Chunky, rutted, cow pie laden. 3-5 folks on the side fixing flat at every descent."
4. **Mile 104 - Little Egypt** - "Rugged terrain makes final selection. Sharp rocks, high-speed danger." Last chance for elite separation.
5. **Mile 160+ - Exposed Prairie** - 2023: "45 mph crosswind hailstorm convinced me sheltering in a ditch was the most prudent course of action."

**Signature Challenge:** Equipment survival. "The fastest tire at Unbound is the one with air in it."

### HISTORY & REPUTATION

- **Founded:** 2006 (as Dirty Kanza)
- **Origin:** Jim Cummins and Joel Dyke. "We wanted the event to exist so we could ride it." 34 starters, compass required for navigation.
- **Evolution:** Dirty Kanza → Unbound Gravel (2020). Life Time acquired 2018. Now nearly 5,000 riders across all distances.
- **Notable Moments:**
  - 2023 mud disaster: 23% DNF rate, 4 miles of peanut butter mud forced walking
  - Course record 2025: Cameron Jones 8:37:09
  - First race compass navigation now smartphone tracking

**Reputation:** "One of, if not, the toughest gravel races in the world." The community treats finishing as credential, DNFing as education.

### BLACK PILL REALITY

**The Truth:** Your race will probably end because something broke, not because you weren't fit enough.

The forums are littered with the same story: trained for months, flew to Kansas, broken derailleur at mile 40, sat at cattle pens waiting for pickup with 7 other riders and their "battered bodies." 23% of the field DNF'd in 2023. Not because they weren't ready. Because peanut butter mud snapped chains and ate derailleurs alive.

"I heard a loud snap, and my derailleur went crashing into the cassette, instantly bringing me to a stop. The spoke had done more damage than I initially thought. My derailleur's inner pulley cage was broken, and the upper pulley was nowhere to be seen. The chain was twisted up around it all. The whole thing was mangled beyond repair."

The race directors will tell you the mud section "wasn't impassable." They're technically correct. You could walk it. For four miles. While your drivetrain packed with clay until the wheels stopped turning.

**Expectation Reset:** Train your body, yes. But also: learn to convert to singlespeed mid-race. Carry a paint stirrer for mud. Accept that 30% of your pre-rides will result in tire plugging. "Conservative equipment selection > marginal gains." The guy with 38mm slicks and 10 watts better rolling resistance is walking home while you finish on 50mm Ramblers.

### TRAINING PLAN IMPLICATIONS

Based on research, these training considerations are NON-NEGOTIABLE for this race:

**Protocol Triggers:**
- [x] Heat Adaptation: **YES** - Low 90s common, can exceed 100°F. "The heat was definitely a factor. My heat acclimation leading up to Unbound was subpar." Train in similar conditions or overdress.
- [ ] Altitude Protocol: **NO** - Max elevation ~1,500 ft. Irrelevant.
- [x] Technical Skills: **YES** - Not MTB-level, but line choice and bike handling determine whether you're stopping for flats. "Tire worries will slow you down... I would regularly get passed by people as I slowed down to pick careful lines."
- [x] Durability Focus: **YES** - The race breaks people in the final third. 12-16 hour efforts for mid-pack. "Everyone feels this dark place, and it usually goes away if you wait long enough. Good endurance racers push through until they experience a second wind. During a super long race, they might go through this multiple times."
- [x] Fueling Strategy: **YES** - 70-78 mile gaps between crew access. Water oases at 40 and 112. "Unbound is just an eating contest." "Eat early and often. Choose fuel you can reliably get down in the heat after many hours."

**Race-Specific Training Emphasis:**
1. **Duration tolerance** - 12-16 hour efforts for mid-pack. Build to 100+ mile training rides. The race isn't about peak power - it's about what you can sustain at hour 14.
2. **Heat adaptation** - If racing from a cool climate, overdress for long rides, add sauna work, arrive early for Kansas heat exposure.
3. **Mechanical self-sufficiency** - Practice tire plugging, chain repair, singlespeed conversion under fatigue. "Chain breakers add weight but can save your race if you snap your chain or destroy your rear derailleur."

**The One Thing That Will Get You:**
Forum consensus is unanimous: **Pacing the first 90 minutes.**

"Mile 28 is the first important point. I surged to make sure I led the entire pack. This extremely rough double track was much easier to take being on the front."

But also: "I went out too hard trying to stick with fast riders. After the first checkpoint around mile 80, I was completely blown up."

The tension is real. Go too easy and you're stuck in the chaos of 1,100 riders on narrow gravel. Go too hard and you blow up before Alma. The answer is position, not pace - be at the front through mile 28 without redlining, then settle into sustainable effort.
