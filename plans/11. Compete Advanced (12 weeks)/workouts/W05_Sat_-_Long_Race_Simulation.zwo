  <name>W05 Sat - Long Race Simulation</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: First 2 hours Z2 → 3x20 min @ 95-100% FTP (8 min easy between) → 4x3 min @ 110-115% FTP (3 min easy) → Final 1.5 hours Z2 • Race simulation. Sustained threshold followed by VO2 surges when fatigued—exactly like racing. Practice all race systems: nutrition (80g carbs/hour), hydration, pacing, mental focus. • CADENCE WORK: Threshold mix, VO2 high cadence.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&gt;90 min high intensity/intervals/heat: 90g carbs/hr. 1.5 bottles/hr minimum. 1000-1500 mg sodium/hr. Aggressive cooling: ice sock, dump water, shade stops when practical. Replace ~75% of losses within 2 hours post-ride.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - AGGRESSIVE FUELING:
Target 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on dress rehearsal). Train your gut aggressively. This is critical for Unbound Gravel 200's long day. Competitors need aggressive fueling—race day isn't the time to discover your stomach can't handle 80g carbs/hour. Practice your race-day nutrition products. Start fueling from mile 1.

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 264-minute rides, aim for 4 position changes.</description>
