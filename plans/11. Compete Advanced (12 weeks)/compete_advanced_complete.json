This plan uses Threshold-Focused Block Periodization—concentrated threshold work builds race-pace power, supported by VO2max (for surges) and durability (for finishing strong). Gravel racing is primarily a threshold sport. Master threshold, master gravel.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Comprehensive assessment. Tuesday has FTP + power profile testing. Thursday has LT1 + durability assessment. Saturday is long pyramidal ride (4-5 hours). Sunday has VO2max touch + strength. This week establishes your baseline.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Fine to ride if you really want, but no longer than an hour and don't break 30 TSS.",
