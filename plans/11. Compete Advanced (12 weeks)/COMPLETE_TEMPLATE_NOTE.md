- ⏳ Weeks 8-10: Block 2 Race Sharpening (21 workouts)
- ⏳ Weeks 11-12: Taper & Race (14 workouts)

## Total Required
- Week 1: 7 workouts
- Weeks 2-5: 4 blocks × 4 weeks × 7 workouts = 112 workouts
- Weeks 6-7: 14 workouts

## Structure
The template uses `workouts_by_block` for Weeks 2-5 (similar to FINISHER SAVE MY RACE structure), then standard `workouts` arrays for Weeks 6-12.

## Next Steps
Due to the complexity and size of this plan, the full template needs to be built incrementally. The structure is correct - all that remains is populating Weeks 3-12 with all workouts following the same patterns established in Week 2.

## Key Features Applied
- ✅ Block Periodization structure
- ✅ G-Spot terminology (replaces Sweet Spot)
- ✅ Cadence work on all intervals
- ✅ Rhythm intervals in Block 2 (Weeks 8-10)
- ✅ Loaded intervals in Block 2 (Weeks 9-10)
- ✅ Monday week previews
- ✅ Rest day TSS limits
- ✅ Strength notes (not blocks)
