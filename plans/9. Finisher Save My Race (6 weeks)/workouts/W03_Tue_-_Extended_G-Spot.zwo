  <name>W03 Tue - Extended G-Spot</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min warmup → 4x15 min @ 87-92% FTP (5 min easy between) → 15 min cooldown • 60 cumulative minutes at G-Spot. Peak volume. Break into 5-min segments mentally. • CADENCE WORK: Alternate high and low cadence. Intervals 1, 3 at high cadence (100+ rpm), intervals 2, 4 at low cadence (40-60 rpm).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT ACCLIMATIZATION (Weeks 3-5):
Complete this quality session in COOL conditions (preserve workout quality). After workout, add heat exposure:

POST-EXERCISE OPTION:
• 30-40 min hot bath at 40°C (104°F) OR
• 25-30 min sauna at 80-100°C

EFFECT: Heat adaptation without compromising interval quality. Research shows post-exercise heat exposure produces adaptations comparable to active heat training.

NOTE: Heat training should NOT compromise workout quality. Reserve active heat training for easy endurance rides.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - AGGRESSIVE FUELING:
Target 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on dress rehearsal). Train your gut aggressively. This is critical for Unbound Gravel 200's long day. Competitors need aggressive fueling—race day isn't the time to discover your stomach can't handle 80g carbs/hour. Practice your race-day nutrition products. Start fueling from mile 1.</description>
