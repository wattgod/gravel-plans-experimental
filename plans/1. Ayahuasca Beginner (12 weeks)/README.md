**Goal:** Build minimum fitness to survive race day with maximum time efficiency

## JSON Template

The `template.json` file contains:
- ✅ Plan metadata
- ✅ All 12 weeks (84 workouts total)
- ✅ Default modifications (HIIT philosophy, cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals, survival mode considerations)

## Key Features

### HIIT-Focused Philosophy
- **Maximum Fitness in Minimum Time:** HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) gives maximum fitness in minimum time
- **Short, Hard Bursts:** Builds both aerobic and anaerobic capacity faster than long slow rides
- **Every Minute Counts:** With 0-5 hours/week, every minute on the bike must count
- **Survival Mode:** Accepts reality that 0-5 hours/week is NOT enough to train properly, but you WILL finish if you execute consistently

### Reality Check
- **Brutal Honesty:** 0-5 hours per week is NOT enough to train properly for a gravel race
- **But Life Happens:** Work, family, responsibilities limit your time
- **You Won't Be Competitive:** You won't feel amazing
- **But You WILL Finish:** If you (1) Execute this plan consistently, (2) Start the race VERY conservatively, (3) Fuel aggressively from mile 1

### Volume Structure
- **Week 1:** Foundation & Reality Check (0-3.5 hours)
- **Week 2:** Building HIIT Tolerance (0-4 hours)
- **Week 3:** Peak HIIT Volume (0-4.5 hours) - Biggest week
- **Week 4:** Recovery & Adaptation (0-3 hours)
- **Weeks 5-7:** Build Phase (0-5 hours)
- **Week 8:** Recovery & Adaptation (0-3 hours)
- **Weeks 9-10:** Race Prep (0-4.75 hours)
- **Week 11:** Taper (0-3.5 hours)
- **Week 12:** Race Week (0-2.5 hours)

### HIIT Training
- **Short Bursts:** 20-60 seconds ALL OUT (sprint-level effort)
- **Full Recovery:** 90 seconds to 3 minutes easy recovery between intervals
- **Maximum Stimulus:** Builds fitness fast with minimal time investment
- **Minimum Effective Dose:** One HIIT session per week is minimum. Zero sessions = reconsider doing this race.

### Sustained Efforts
- **"Moderately Hard" Pace:** Not HIIT, not easy—pace you could hold for 10-15 minutes
- **Race Pace Simulation:** Builds threshold power in time-efficient way
- **Time-Efficient:** Maximum fitness gains in minimum time

### Changing Pace Philosophy
- **Base Period (Weeks 1-4):**
  - High cadence work (100+ rpm seated) on HIIT intervals
  - Low cadence/torque work (40-60 rpm seated, big gear) on HIIT intervals
  - Alternates to teach power production in different ways

- **Build Period (Weeks 5-8):**
  - Mix of high/low cadence work on HIIT intervals
  - **Rhythm Intervals** introduced on sustained efforts (Weeks 5, 6, 7):
    - Pattern: 2 min Z3 (self-selected cadence) + 1 min Z4 (high cadence 100+ rpm) x 3, continuous
    - Simulates race variability

- **Peak Period (Weeks 9-12):**
  - **Loaded Intervals** introduced on race simulation rides (Weeks 9, 10):
    - Pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 9-14 min Z3 (self-selected cadence)
    - Simulates race starts and surges
  - Rhythm intervals continue
  - Mix of cadence work throughout

### Strength Training
- **NOT incorporated into workout blocks**
- **Notes added** suggesting athlete performs own strength program
- **Suggested on lighter training days** (typically rest days)
- **Survival mode prioritizes cycling work**

### Monday Week Previews
- All Monday rest days include:
  - Week overview with survival mode reminders
  - Reality checks (accept underprepared, conservative pacing, aggressive fueling)
  - Key workouts highlighted (especially long rides and HIIT sessions)
  - Countdown to race
  - Mental toughness guidance
  - Race execution guidance

### Rest Day Limits
- All rest days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday):
  - Fine to ride if desired
  - Max 1 hour
  - Max 30 TSS

## Week Structure

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Monday:** Rest with week preview + survival mode reminders + reality checks + rest day note
- **Tuesday:** HIIT session (primary quality work)
- **Wednesday:** Rest
- **Thursday:** HIIT session #2 OR sustained efforts (if time allows)
- **Friday:** Rest
- **Saturday:** Longer ride (if time allows) - longest ride of week
- **Sunday:** Rest or optional easy spin

## Survival Mode Training Principles

### Why HIIT Works for Survival Mode:
- **Maximum Fitness in Minimum Time:** Short, hard bursts build both aerobic and anaerobic capacity faster than long slow rides
- **Time-Efficient:** Every minute counts when you only have 0-5 hours/week
- **Minimum Effective Dose:** One HIIT session per week is minimum. Two is ideal.

### Key Principles:
- **Every minute counts:** No junk miles
- **Quality over quantity:** HIIT sessions are primary work
- **Flexible schedule:** Life happens—skip optional rides if needed
- **No guilt:** If you can't ride, don't feel guilty. Just do what you can next week.

### What Works:
- HIIT built fitness fast with minimal time
- Short intense bursts = maximum efficiency
- You survived on limited prep
- Mental toughness got you through

### Reality Check:
- **Training Volume:** 10-48 total training hours over 12 weeks
- **Race Duration:** 4-8+ hours
- **Gap is HUGE:** Accept it now—race day will hurt
- **Final Hours:** Will be survival mode. That's OK—mental toughness gets you through.

### Race Execution:
- **START VERY CONSERVATIVELY:** Way easier than you think
- **Fuel Aggressively:** From mile 1 (50-60g carbs/hour MINIMUM)
- **Accept Underprepared:** You're underprepared—accept it. Now execute survival plan.
- **Mental Toughness:** When it gets hard (and it will), mental toughness gets you home.

### Post-Race Reflection:
- **What Worked:** HIIT built fitness fast, short intense bursts = maximum efficiency, you survived on limited prep, mental toughness got you through
- **What You Learned:** Training volume matters (you felt it HARD in final hours), 0-5 hrs/week is survival mode not performance mode, conservative pacing + aggressive fueling = survival formula, you can finish undertrained if you're smart and tough
- **Next Time:** If you want to ENJOY the race: need 8-12 hrs/week minimum. If stuck with 3-5 hrs/week: look at Ayahuasca Intermediate plan. If only 0-5 hrs/week possible: you now know what survival mode feels like. Start training EARLIER—12 weeks minimum, 16-20 weeks better.

## Survival Mode Training Principles

### Maximum ROI for Minimal Time
- **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):** Short, hard bursts build both aerobic and anaerobic capacity faster than long slow rides
- **20-60 Second Bursts:** ALL OUT efforts (sprint-level)
- **Full Recovery:** 90 seconds to 3 minutes easy recovery between intervals
- **Minimum Effective Dose:** One HIIT session per week is minimum. Two is ideal.

### Race Execution
- **Conservative Start:** START VERY CONSERVATIVELY (way easier than you think)
- **Aggressive Fueling:** Fuel from mile 1 (50-60g carbs/hour MINIMUM)
- **Accept Underprepared:** You're underprepared—accept it. Now execute survival plan.
- **Mental Toughness:** Final hours will be pure survival—everyone's hurt, you just keep moving forward.

### Post-Race Reality Check
- **What Worked:** HIIT built fitness fast, short intense bursts = maximum efficiency, you survived on limited prep, mental toughness got you through
- **How Did You Perform:** If you finished = plan worked. You survived. That's the win.
- **Key Lessons:** Training volume matters (you felt it HARD in final hours), 0-5 hrs/week is survival mode not performance mode, conservative pacing + aggressive fueling = survival formula

## Next Steps

Once complete (all 12 weeks), this template can be used like other survival mode plans:
- Load template.json
- Load nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
- Apply race-specific modifications
- Generate race-specific plan

**Remember:** 0-5 hrs/week + 12 weeks = SURVIVAL MODE. You survived. That's the win.
