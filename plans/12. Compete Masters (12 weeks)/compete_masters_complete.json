This plan uses HRV-Guided Polarized training—80% easy, 20% hard, with recovery driving the schedule. Masters athletes adapt differently: we need more recovery between hard sessions, but we can still build exceptional race fitness.\n\n• WEEK PREVIEW: Tuesday has FTP + assessment testing. Wednesday is easy. Thursday has polarized intensity introduction. Saturday is long aerobic base. Sunday is easy + strength assessment.\n\n• HRV GUIDANCE: If using HRV, check morning reading before intensity days. Green = proceed. Yellow = reduce intensity 10%. Red = swap for easy day. No HRV? Use perceived fatigue—if legs feel heavy and motivation is low, that's your body saying rest.\n\n• REST DAY NOTE: Complete rest recommended for Masters. Light movement (walk, yoga) is fine.",
