# COMPETE MASTERS Template Completion

## Status
- ✅ Week 1: Complete (7 workouts)
- ✅ Week 2: Complete (7 workouts)
- ⏳ Weeks 3-12: Need to be added (70 workouts)

## Strategy
Given the size and complexity, I'll create a comprehensive Python script that:
1. Generates all remaining weeks (3-12) systematically
2. Follows the plan text provided by the user
3. Scales volumes appropriately (12-18 hours vs 8-12 hours for FINISHER MASTERS)
4. Includes all features:
   - HRV/readiness checks on all quality sessions
   - Polarized 80/20 distribution
   - Masters-specific considerations
   - Cadence work on all intervals
   - Rhythm intervals (Weeks 6-7, 9-10)
   - Loaded intervals (Weeks 9-10)
   - Strength notes (not blocks)
   - Monday week previews
   - Rest day TSS limits

## Volume Scaling
COMPETE MASTERS has 12-18 hours/week vs FINISHER MASTERS 8-12 hours/week:
- Easy rides: 60-120 min → 90-120 min (or longer)
- Long rides: 2.5-4.5 hours → 3-5.5 hours
- Quality sessions: Similar structure, slightly longer warmups/cooldowns

## Next Step
Create comprehensive Python script to generate all remaining weeks.
