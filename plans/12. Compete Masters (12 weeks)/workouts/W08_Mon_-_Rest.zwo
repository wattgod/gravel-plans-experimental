  <name>W08 Mon - Rest</name>
  <description>• Race sharpening begins. Quality over quantity. Every session should leave you feeling sharp, not tired. Four weeks to race. • WEEK PREVIEW: Tuesday has sharpening intervals. Thursday has race openers. Saturday is race simulation. Sunday easy. • HRV GUIDANCE: You should be consistently in green zone. Any suppression = back off immediately. • REST DAY NOTE: Complete rest recommended for Masters. Light movement (walk, yoga) is fine.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
