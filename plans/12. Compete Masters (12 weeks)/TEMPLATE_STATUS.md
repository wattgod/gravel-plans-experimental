# COMPETE MASTERS Template - Status

## Current Status
- ✅ Week 1: Complete (7 workouts)
- ⏳ Weeks 2-12: Need to be populated (77 workouts)

## Plan Overview
- **Philosophy:** Autoregulated (HRV-Based) + Polarized
- **Volume:** 12-18 hours/week
- **Target:** Age 50+, competitive performance goal

## Key Features Required
1. ✅ HRV/Readiness checks before quality sessions (Green/Yellow/Red)
2. ✅ Polarized 80/20 distribution
3. ✅ Masters-specific considerations (FTP × 0.93, 48+ hour recovery, strength notes)
4. ✅ Changing Pace philosophy (cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals)
5. ✅ Strength notes (not blocks) - athlete does own program
6. ✅ Monday week previews
7. ✅ Rest day TSS limits (30 TSS, 1 hour max)

## Structure
Similar to FINISHER MASTERS but with:
- Higher volume (12-18 hours vs 8-12 hours)
- More competitive focus
- Same autoregulation + polarized structure

## Next Steps
Complete Weeks 2-12 following the same pattern as Week 1, with progressive volume/intensity changes as described in the plan text.
