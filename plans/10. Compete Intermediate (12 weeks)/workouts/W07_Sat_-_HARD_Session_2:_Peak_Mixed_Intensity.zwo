  <name>W07 Sat - HARD Session #2: Peak Mixed Intensity</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 20 min easy warmup → 6x4 min @ 110-115% FTP (4 min easy between) → 15 min easy → 2x12 min @ 100-105% FTP (7 min easy between) → 15 min easy cooldown • Peak quality session. Six VO2 efforts then threshold work. Break it down—one interval at a time. Full recovery between efforts. • LOADED INTERVALS: For threshold blocks, try loaded pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 11 min Z3 (self-selected cadence). This simulates race starts. • CADENCE WORK: VO2 intervals—alternate high and low cadence. Threshold blocks—use loaded pattern or rhythm pattern.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HEAT ACCLIMATIZATION (Weeks 6-10):
Complete this quality session in COOL conditions (preserve workout quality). After workout, add heat exposure:

POST-EXERCISE OPTION:
• 30-40 min hot bath at 40°C (104°F) OR
• 25-30 min sauna at 80-100°C

EFFECT: Heat adaptation without compromising interval quality. Research shows post-exercise heat exposure produces adaptations comparable to active heat training.

NOTE: Heat training should NOT compromise workout quality. Reserve active heat training for easy endurance rides.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&gt;90 min high intensity/intervals/heat: 90g carbs/hr. 1.5 bottles/hr minimum. 1000-1500 mg sodium/hr. Aggressive cooling: ice sock, dump water, shade stops when practical. Replace ~75% of losses within 2 hours post-ride.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
