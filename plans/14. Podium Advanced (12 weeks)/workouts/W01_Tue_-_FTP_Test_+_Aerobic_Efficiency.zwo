  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test + Aerobic Efficiency</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 30 min warmup → 5 min all-out → 10 min recovery → 20 min max effort → 15 min easy → 45 min @ 65-70% FTP (monitor HR drift, RPE, fuel efficiency) → 15 min cooldown • FTP test sets zones. Pace it right—sustained 20 minutes. Then 45-min aerobic efficiency test: hold 65-70% FTP and monitor HR drift, perceived effort, and how fueling feels. Elite athletes have minimal drift. Write everything down. FTP = 20-min × 0.95. Calculate aerobic decoupling: if HR drifts &gt;3-5%, aerobic efficiency needs work.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&gt;90 min low intensity: 60g carbs/hr. 1-1.5 bottles/hr. 600-1200 mg sodium/hr depending on heat. Monitor sweat rate—if losing &gt;1-1.5% bodyweight, increase sodium.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 140-minute rides, aim for 2 position changes.</description>
