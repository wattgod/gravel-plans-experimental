# PODIUM ADVANCED - ELITE PREPARATION PLAN (12 weeks)

## Template Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All 12 weeks with 84 workouts

## Plan Overview

**Training Philosophy:** HVLI/LSD-Centric (High Volume, Low Intensity)  
**Target Athlete:** Elite ambition, professional volume capacity, podium/win goal  
**Weekly Hours:** 20-25 hours  
**Goal:** Elite-level preparation through extreme durability and aerobic development

## JSON Template

The `template.json` file contains:
- ✅ Plan metadata
- ✅ All 12 weeks (84 workouts total)
- ✅ Default modifications (HVLI philosophy, cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals)

## Key Features

### HVLI/LSD-Centric Philosophy
- **High Volume:** 20-25 hours/week of mostly Z1-Z2 riding
- **Low Intensity:** Quality sessions embedded in volume context (long warmups/cooldowns)
- **Elite Durability:** Massive aerobic volume builds extreme durability, fat oxidation, and resilience
- **Professional Approach:** This is how professional endurance athletes train

### Volume Structure
- **Weeks 1-4:** Pure base building (14-22.5 hours/week)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Maintain volume, add quality (17-25 hours/week)
- **Weeks 9-12:** Sharpen while preserving durability (18-24 hours/week, then taper)

### Quality Sessions Embedded in Volume
- All quality sessions have long Z2 warmups and cooldowns
- Maintains HVLI principles—quality doesn't sacrifice volume
- Example: 4x20 min G-Spot within 3-3.5 hour ride (60 min warmup, 30 min cooldown)

### Changing Pace Philosophy
- **Base Period (Weeks 1-4):**
  - High cadence work (100+ rpm seated) on intervals
  - Low cadence/torque work (40-60 rpm seated, big gear) on intervals
  - Alternates to teach power production in different ways

- **Build Period (Weeks 5-8):**
  - Mix of high/low cadence work
  - **Rhythm Intervals** introduced (Weeks 6, 7):
    - Pattern: 2 min Z3 (self-selected cadence) + 1 min Z4 (high cadence 100+ rpm) x 4-5, continuous
    - Simulates race variability

- **Peak Period (Weeks 9-12):**
  - **Loaded Intervals** introduced (Weeks 9, 10):
    - Pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 19 min Z3 (self-selected cadence)
    - Simulates race starts and surges
  - Rhythm intervals continue
  - Mix of cadence work throughout

### G-Spot Terminology
- Replaces "Sweet Spot"
- Range: 87-92% FTP (1% lower than traditional Sweet Spot)
- Used in Build phase quality sessions

### Strength Training
- **NOT incorporated into workout blocks**
- **Notes added** suggesting athlete performs own strength program
- **Suggested on lighter training days** (typically Sunday after long rides)
- **Phases:**
  - Weeks 1-4: Max Strength (heavy loads, 5x5 @ 85-90% 1RM)
  - Weeks 5-7: Explosive Strength (light loads, maximum velocity)
  - Weeks 8-10: Durability/Stability Strength (higher reps, lower weight)
  - Weeks 11-12: Maintenance (light, movement quality)

### Monday Week Previews
- All Monday rest days include:
  - Week overview with HVLI reminders
  - Key workouts highlighted (especially long rides)
  - Volume expectations (20-25 hours/week)
  - Elite performance guidance
  - Countdown to race
  - Tactical preparation tips

### Rest Day Limits
- All rest days (Monday, Friday):
  - Fine to ride if desired
  - Max 1 hour
  - Max 30 TSS

## Week Structure

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Monday:** Rest or very easy spin with week preview + rest day note
- **Tuesday-Sunday:** 6 workouts (mix of easy endurance volume, quality sessions embedded in volume, long rides, strength notes)

## Elite Considerations

### Volume Requirements
- **Minimum:** 20 hours/week
- **Target:** 20-25 hours/week
- **If you don't have this time, this isn't your plan**

### Durability Focus
- Extreme durability through massive aerobic volume
- Long rides: 6-9 hours in peak weeks
- Back-to-back long days (Saturday-Sunday)
- Quality sessions embedded in volume context

### Quality in Volume Context
- All quality sessions have long Z2 warmups (60-90 min) and cooldowns (30-90 min)
- Maintains HVLI principles
- Example: 3x25 min threshold within 5+ hour ride

## Template Statistics

- **Total weeks:** 12
- **Total workouts:** 84 (12 weeks × 7 workouts)
- **File size:** ~80KB JSON
- **Structure:** Complete with all workout descriptions and ZWO blocks

## Usage with Cursor AI

To generate a race-specific plan:

1. **Load template:**
   ```
   Load: current/plans/14. Podium Advanced (12 weeks)/template.json
   Load: current/guidelines/nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
   ```

2. **Provide race-specific considerations:**
   ```
   Race: [RACE NAME]
   - Heat training needed
   - Aggressive fueling: 80-100g carbs/hour
   - Dress rehearsal: [X]-hour ride Week [Y]
   - Robust taper: Week [Z]
   - Gravel Grit: Week [Z] race day
   ```

3. **Cursor will generate:**
   - Modified Python script
   - 84 ZWO files (or modified count based on race)
   - Modifications document

## HVLI Training Principles

### Volume Distribution
- **Z1-Z2 (55-75% FTP):** 18-22 hours/week (80-90% of total time)
- **Z3 (76-94% FTP):** Tempo touches only (5-10% of total time)
- **Z4-Z5+ (95%+ FTP):** Quality sessions (5-10% of total time)

### Elite Durability
- Massive aerobic volume builds:
  - Extreme durability
  - Fat oxidation capacity
  - Mitochondrial density
  - Capillary density
  - Resilience to fatigue

### Quality Embedded in Volume
- All quality sessions maintain volume context
- Long warmups/cooldowns preserve HVLI principles
- Quality doesn't sacrifice volume—this is elite training

## Next Steps
