## Key Features

### GOAT (Gravel Optimized Adaptive Training) Philosophy

GOAT isn't a single training method—it's an **INTEGRATED SYSTEM** combining the best of all proven approaches:

#### Core Components:

1. **Pyramidal Base (80/10/10)**
   - Most time in Z2, moderate Z3/tempo, small Z4+
   - Sustainable high-volume distribution
   - Weeks 1-4, 4, 8: Pure pyramidal

2. **Polarized Micro-Cycles (80/20)**
   - Some weeks shift to pure easy/hard split
   - 80% Z1-Z2 (easy), 20% Z4-Z5+ (hard), almost NO Z3
   - Weeks 5-7: Polarized weeks for sharpening

3. **Limiter-Focused Blocks**
   - 2-4 week concentrated loading on specific weakness
   - Weeks 2-3: Block 1 (VO2max, Threshold, or Durability)
   - Choose based on Week 1 assessment

4. **G-Spot Efficiency (87-92% FTP)**
   - Replaces "Sweet Spot"
   - Time-crunched efficiency layer
   - Used in Durability block

5. **Multi-Signal Autoregulation**
   - HRV + RPE + CTL/TSB + power durability + HR drift
   - Daily adjustments based on monitoring signals
   - **CRITICAL:** GOAT requires YOU to be co-pilot, not passenger

6. **Adaptive Testing**
   - FTP/CP/LT1/VO2 triggered by training phase and readiness signals
   - Week 1: Comprehensive assessment

### Volume Structure

- **Week 1:** Assessment & Baseline (14-17.5 hours)
- **Weeks 2-3:** Block 1 Loading (17-24 hours)
- **Week 4:** Recovery & Transmutation (12-15 hours)
- **Weeks 5-7:** Polarized Micro-Cycles (17-25 hours)
- **Week 8:** Recovery (12-15 hours)
- **Weeks 9-10:** Race Sharpening (18-24 hours)
- **Week 11:** Taper (14-17.5 hours)
- **Week 12:** Race Week (8-12.5 hours)

### Block Options (Weeks 2-3)

Based on Week 1 assessment, choose ONE:

#### Block A: VO2max Block
- **If:** 5-min power <118% FTP
- **Focus:** VO2max intervals (110-120% FTP)
- **Structure:** 6-7x5 min, 8-10x4 min, embedded in long rides
- **Strength:** Explosive (box jumps, med ball, jump squats)

#### Block B: Threshold Block
- **If:** Threshold endurance weak (power decay >5%)
- **Focus:** Threshold intervals (100-105% FTP)
- **Structure:** 3-4x20 min, 2-3x30 min, embedded in long rides
- **Strength:** Max strength (heavy squats, deadlifts)

#### Block C: Durability Block
- **If:** Power fades in long rides
- **Focus:** G-Spot (87-92% FTP) and tempo (80-85% FTP) volume
- **Structure:** 5-6x20-30 min G-Spot, 4-5x30 min tempo, 7-8 hour weekend rides
- **Strength:** Durability (higher reps, lower weight)

### Polarized Micro-Cycles (Weeks 5-7)

After building limiter and base, GOAT switches to **POLARIZED weeks**:
- **80% Z1-Z2 (easy):** Conversational pace entire time
- **20% Z4-Z5+ (hard):** Lungs burning, full recovery between reps
- **Almost NO Z3:** Sharpens both ends while maintaining volume

**Structure:**
- Tuesday, Thursday, Friday: Easy (2-4 hours Z2)
- Wednesday: HARD Session #1 (VO2max OR Threshold)
- Saturday: HARD Session #2 (Different system than Wednesday)
- Sunday: Long Easy (6-8 hours Z2)

### Race Sharpening (Weeks 9-10)

GOAT shifts to **RACE-SPECIFIC work**:
- Combined intensities (VO2max + Threshold)
- Variable efforts (not steady-state)
- Race simulations (long rides with varied intensity)
- **Rhythm Intervals:** 2 min Z3 + 1 min Z4 patterns
- **Loaded Intervals:** 1 min Z5/Z6 → settle into Z3

### Changing Pace Philosophy

- **Base Period (Weeks 1-4):**
  - High cadence work (100+ rpm seated) on intervals
  - Low cadence/torque work (40-60 rpm seated, big gear) on intervals
  - Alternates to teach power production in different ways

- **Build Period (Weeks 5-8):**
  - Mix of high/low cadence work
  - **Rhythm Intervals** introduced (Weeks 6, 7):
    - Pattern: 2 min Z3 (self-selected cadence) + 1 min Z4 (high cadence 100+ rpm) x 4-5, continuous
    - Simulates race variability

- **Peak Period (Weeks 9-12):**
  - **Loaded Intervals** introduced (Weeks 9, 10):
    - Pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 19 min Z3 (self-selected cadence)
    - Simulates race starts and surges
  - Rhythm intervals continue
  - Mix of cadence work throughout

### G-Spot Terminology
- Replaces "Sweet Spot"
- Range: 87-92% FTP (1% lower than traditional Sweet Spot)
- Used in Durability block

### Strength Training
- **NOT incorporated into workout blocks**
- **Notes added** suggesting athlete performs own strength program
- **Suggested on lighter training days** (typically Sunday after long rides)
- **Phases:**
  - Weeks 1-4: Max Strength (heavy loads, 5x5 @ 85-90% 1RM)
  - Weeks 2-3 (VO2 block): Explosive Strength (light loads, maximum velocity)
  - Weeks 2-3 (Durability block): Durability Strength (higher reps, lower weight)
  - Weeks 5-7: Stability/Explosive (depending on next block)
  - Weeks 8-10: Maintenance (light loads, movement quality)
  - Weeks 11-12: Optional (light core/mobility)

### Monday Week Previews
- All Monday rest days include:
  - Week overview with GOAT philosophy reminders
  - Key workouts highlighted (especially long rides and quality sessions)
  - Multi-signal monitoring guidance
  - Volume expectations (20-25 hours/week)
  - Elite performance guidance
  - Countdown to race
  - Tactical preparation tips

### Rest Day Limits
- All rest days (Monday, Friday):
  - Fine to ride if desired
  - Max 1 hour
  - Max 30 TSS

## Multi-Signal Monitoring

### Daily Signals:
- **Morning HRV** (upon waking, still in bed, 5-min reading)
- **Subjective readiness** (1-10 scale)
- **Sleep quality/duration**
- **Resting HR**

### Per Workout Signals:
- **RPE** (1-10 scale) immediately post-workout
- **HR drift** (if steady-state work)
- **Power decay** (if intervals)
- **Subjective difficulty** relative to prescribed effort

### Weekly Signals:
- **CTL** (chronic training load)—should increase gradually
- **TSB** (training stress balance)—should be negative (fatigue accumulating) during blocks, positive during taper
- **Block-specific KPI trends** (power improving? HR drift decreasing? Durability increasing?)

### GOAT Decision Points:
- **HRV consistently low (2+ days)** → Insert extra rest day
- **Performance declining in workouts** (power dropping, RPE spiking) → Reduce volume 20%
- **Injury/illness signs** → Stop block, return to pyramidal easy riding
- **Performance exceeding expectations** → Continue block, consider extending

## GOAT Training Principles

### Why GOAT Works:
- **Flexible enough** to adapt to YOUR daily state (via autoregulation)
- **Targeted enough** to fix YOUR specific limiters (via block periodization)
- **Sustainable enough** for long-term training (via pyramidal/polarized distribution)
- **Evidence-based** across multiple training philosophies (composite best practices)

### Who GOAT Is For:
- Athletes who can **MONITOR** (HRV, power data, RPE, sleep, readiness)
- Athletes who can **ADJUST** (discipline to back off when signals say so)
- Athletes with **VOLUME CAPACITY** (20-25 hrs/week)
- Athletes with **COACHING JUDGMENT** (or actual coach to interpret signals)

### Who GOAT Is NOT For:
- Athletes wanting "just tell me what to do" templates
- Athletes refusing data monitoring/feedback
- Athletes wanting purely intuitive training
- Athletes without time for sophisticated analysis

### CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
**GOAT requires YOU to be co-pilot, not passenger.** You adjust training based on signals. This plan provides the FRAMEWORK—YOU make daily/weekly decisions based on monitoring data.

## Next Steps

Once complete (all 12 weeks), this template can be used like other Podium plans:
- Load template.json
- Load nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
- Apply race-specific modifications
- Generate race-specific plan

**Remember:** GOAT isn't about following a plan—it's about **BECOMING YOUR OWN COACH** through sophisticated monitoring and adaptive decision-making.
