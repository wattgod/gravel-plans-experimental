  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test (if feeling good) or Easy Ride</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min warmup → 3 min moderate → 5 min easy → 20 min sustained effort (not all-out, controlled) → 10 min cooldown • HRV Check First: Green light? Do test. Red light? Skip test, ride easy 30-45 min, try test next week. Masters athletes don't need maximal testing—sustained 20-min effort at "hard but sustainable" pace. Multiply avg power × 0.93 = FTP (more conservative for Masters). Write it down. • CADENCE: Self-selected for test effort.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
