# AYAHUASCA INTERMEDIATE - TIME-CRUNCHED PLAN (12 weeks)

## Template Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All 12 weeks with 84 workouts

## Plan Overview

**Training Philosophy:** G-Spot/Threshold (Time-Crunched)  
**Target Athlete:** Intermediate cyclist, time-crunched (3-5 hrs/week), performance-focused finish  
**Weekly Hours:** 3-5 hours  
**Goal:** Maximum FTP gains and race-ready threshold power with minimal time investment

## JSON Template

The `template.json` file contains:
- ✅ Plan metadata
- ✅ All 12 weeks (84 workouts total)
- ✅ Default modifications (G-Spot terminology, cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals, time-crunched considerations)

## Key Features

### Time-Crunched Philosophy
- **Minimal Volume:** 3-5 hours/week - every minute counts
- **Quality Over Quantity:** 2-3 quality sessions per week, everything else rest or very light recovery
- **No Junk Miles:** Every minute on the bike must count
- **Aggressive Rest:** Time-crunched = quality over quantity. Save energy for hard sessions
- **FTP Focus:** Maximum FTP gains and race-ready threshold power with minimal time investment

### Volume Structure
- **Week 1:** Foundation & FTP Baseline (2-3.5 hours)
- **Week 2:** G-Spot Foundation Building (2.5-4.25 hours)
- **Week 3:** Peak G-Spot Volume (3-5 hours) - Biggest week
- **Week 4:** Recovery & Adaptation (1.75-3 hours)
- **Weeks 5-7:** Build Phase (2.5-5 hours)
- **Week 8:** Recovery & Transmutation (1.75-3 hours)
- **Weeks 9-10:** Race Prep (2.75-4.75 hours)
- **Week 11:** Taper (2-3.5 hours)
- **Week 12:** Race Week (1.25-2.5 hours)

### G-Spot/Threshold Focus
- **G-Spot (87-92% FTP):** Primary intensity - "uncomfortably sustainable"
- **Threshold (95-105% FTP):** Race pace intensity - hard but sustainable
- **Time-Efficient:** Maximum fitness gains in minimum time
- **FTP Gains:** Focused intensity builds FTP without excessive volume

### Changing Pace Philosophy
- **Base Period (Weeks 1-4):**
  - High cadence work (100+ rpm seated) on intervals
  - Low cadence/torque work (40-60 rpm seated, big gear) on intervals
  - Alternates to teach power production in different ways

- **Build Period (Weeks 5-8):**
  - Mix of high/low cadence work
  - **Rhythm Intervals** introduced (Weeks 6, 7):
    - Pattern: 2 min Z3 (self-selected cadence) + 1 min Z4 (high cadence 100+ rpm) x 3-4, continuous
    - Simulates race variability

- **Peak Period (Weeks 9-12):**
  - **Loaded Intervals** introduced (Weeks 9, 10):
    - Pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 9-14 min Z3 (self-selected cadence)
    - Simulates race starts and surges
  - Rhythm intervals continue
  - Mix of cadence work throughout

### G-Spot Terminology
- Replaces "Sweet Spot"
- Range: 87-92% FTP (1% lower than traditional Sweet Spot)
- Used throughout plan as primary intensity

### Strength Training
- **NOT incorporated into workout blocks**
- **Notes added** suggesting athlete performs own strength program
- **Suggested on lighter training days** (typically rest days)
- **Time-crunched plans prioritize cycling work**

### Monday Week Previews
- All Monday rest days include:
  - Week overview with time-crunched reminders
  - Key workouts highlighted (especially long rides and quality sessions)
  - FTP gains focus
  - Quality over quantity reminders
  - Countdown to race
  - Race execution guidance

### Rest Day Limits
- All rest days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday):
  - Fine to ride if desired
  - Max 1 hour
  - Max 30 TSS

## Week Structure

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Monday:** Rest with week preview + time-crunched reminders + rest day note
- **Tuesday:** Quality session - G-Spot or Threshold
- **Wednesday:** Rest
- **Thursday:** Quality session - G-Spot or Threshold
- **Friday:** Rest
- **Saturday:** Key session (longest ride of week, mixed intensity)
- **Sunday:** Rest or optional easy spin

## Time-Crunched Training Principles

### Why G-Spot/Threshold Works:
- **Maximum ROI:** Delivers maximum fitness gains in minimum time
- **FTP Gains:** Focused intensity builds FTP without excessive volume
- **Race-Ready Power:** Threshold work develops race pace power
- **Time-Efficient:** 3-5 hrs/week is enough for PERFORMANCE, not just completion

### Key Principles:
- **Every minute counts:** No junk miles
- **Quality over quantity:** 2-3 quality sessions per week
- **Aggressive rest:** Save energy for hard sessions
- **FTP focus:** Maximum FTP gains and race-ready threshold power

### What Works:
- G-Spot (87-92% FTP) built threshold base efficiently
- Threshold work (95-100% FTP) developed race pace power
- 3-5 hrs/week was enough for PERFORMANCE, not just completion
- Time-crunched = every minute counted, no junk miles
- FTP gains came from focused intensity, not volume

## Template Statistics

- **Total weeks:** 12
- **Total workouts:** 84 (12 weeks × 7 workouts)
- **File size:** ~45KB JSON
- **Structure:** Complete with all workout descriptions and ZWO blocks

## Usage with Cursor AI

To generate a race-specific plan:

1. **Load template:**
   ```
   Load: current/plans/2. Ayahuasca Intermediate (12 weeks)/template.json
   Load: current/guidelines/nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
   ```

2. **Provide race-specific considerations:**
   ```
   Race: [RACE NAME]
   - Heat training needed (if applicable)
   - Aggressive fueling: 50-60g carbs/hour
   - Conservative pacing reminders
   - Mental toughness guidance
   ```

3. **Cursor will generate:**
   - Modified Python script
   - 84 ZWO files
   - Modifications document

## Time-Crunched Training Principles

### Maximum ROI for Limited Time
- **G-Spot (87-92% FTP):** Builds threshold base efficiently
- **Threshold (95-105% FTP):** Develops race pace power
- **2-3 Quality Sessions/Week:** Everything else rest or very light recovery
- **No Junk Miles:** Every minute on the bike counts

### Race Execution
- **Conservative Start:** Pace conservatively early
- **Aggressive Fueling:** Fuel from mile 1 (50-60g carbs/hour minimum)
- **Use FTP Gains:** In final third, push when others fade
- **Finish Strong:** 12 weeks of G-Spot and Threshold built that fitness

### Post-Race Reflection
- **What Worked:** G-Spot/Threshold training, quality over quantity, focused intensity
- **How Did You Perform:** If finished strong and competitive = plan worked perfectly
- **Key Lessons:** Time-crunched athletes CAN perform with smart training

## Next Steps

Once complete (all 12 weeks), this template can be used like other time-crunched plans:
- Load template.json
- Load nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
- Apply race-specific modifications
- Generate race-specific plan

**Remember:** With only 3-5 hours per week, G-Spot and Threshold work delivers maximum FTP gains and race-ready power. You just proved it works.
