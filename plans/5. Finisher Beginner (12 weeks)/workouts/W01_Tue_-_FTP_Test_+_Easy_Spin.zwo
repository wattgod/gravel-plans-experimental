  <name>W01 Tue - FTP Test + Easy Spin</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min warmup → 5 min all-out → 10 min recovery → 20 min max effort → 15 min cooldown • This sets your training zones for the entire plan. Go hard but not stupid—you need to sustain 20 minutes, not win it in the first 5. Write down your average power for the 20 minutes, multiply by 0.95. That's your FTP.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).

• POSITION ALTERNATION:
While racing you get as aero as possible (drops), but in training people often try to produce maximum power (hoods, out of saddle). These aren't the same thing. Alternate position every 30 minutes: 30 min in the drops (aero, race position) → 30 min in the hoods (power production, comfort). This builds both aero efficiency and power production. For 65-minute rides, aim for 1 position change.</description>
