# AYAHUASCA SAVE MY RACE - 6 WEEK EMERGENCY PLAN

## Template Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All 6 weeks with 42 workouts

## Plan Overview

**Training Philosophy:** G-Spot/Threshold (Emergency Sharpening)  
**Target Athlete:** Emergency situation, minimal time (3-5 hrs/week), needs to finish in 6 weeks  
**Weekly Hours:** 3-5 hours  
**Goal:** Get race-ready FAST with time-efficient training, accept compromises

## JSON Template

The `template.json` file contains:
- ✅ Plan metadata
- ✅ All 6 weeks (42 workouts total)
- ✅ Default modifications (G-Spot terminology, cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals, emergency considerations)

## Key Features

### Emergency Philosophy
- **Minimal Volume:** 3-5 hours/week - every session must count
- **Time-Efficient:** G-Spot and Threshold work give maximum bang-for-buck
- **Reality Checks:** Longest ride is 2 hours, race might be 4-8+ hours
- **Conservative Pacing:** START CONSERVATIVELY - you don't have endurance to recover from going out hard
- **Aggressive Fueling:** Fuel from mile 1 (50-60g carbs/hour minimum) - covers endurance gaps

### Volume Structure
- **Week 1:** Rapid Assessment (2-3.5 hours)
- **Week 2:** Building G-Spot Foundation (2.5-4.25 hours)
- **Week 3:** Peak G-Spot Volume (3-5 hours) - Biggest week
- **Week 4:** Recovery & Absorption (1.75-3 hours)
- **Week 5:** Race Preparation (2.5-4.25 hours)
- **Week 6:** Race Week (1.25-2.5 hours)

### G-Spot/Threshold Focus
- **G-Spot (87-92% FTP):** "Uncomfortably sustainable" - bread and butter for emergency plans
- **Threshold (95-100% FTP):** Race pace intensity - hard but sustainable
- **Time-Efficient:** Builds threshold power without excessive fatigue
- **Maximum Bang-for-Buck:** Every minute on the bike counts

### Changing Pace Philosophy
- **Base Period (Weeks 1-4):**
  - High cadence work (100+ rpm seated) on intervals
  - Low cadence/torque work (40-60 rpm seated, big gear) on intervals
  - Alternates to teach power production in different ways

- **Build Period (Week 5):**
  - **Rhythm Intervals** introduced:
    - Pattern: 2 min Z3 (self-selected cadence) + 1 min Z4 (high cadence 100+ rpm) x 3, continuous
    - Simulates race variability
  - **Loaded Intervals** introduced:
    - Pattern: 1 min Z5/Z6 (high cadence, seated) → settle into 14 min Z3 (self-selected cadence)
    - Simulates race starts and surges

- **Peak Period (Week 6):**
  - Race openers with high cadence (100+ rpm)
  - Final sharpness before race

### G-Spot Terminology
- Replaces "Sweet Spot"
- Range: 87-92% FTP (1% lower than traditional Sweet Spot)
- Used throughout plan as primary intensity

### Strength Training
- **NOT incorporated into workout blocks**
- **Notes added** suggesting athlete performs own strength program
- **Suggested on lighter training days** (typically rest days)
- **Emergency plans prioritize time-efficient cycling work**

### Monday Week Previews
- All Monday rest days include:
  - Week overview with emergency plan reminders
  - Key workouts highlighted (especially long rides)
  - Reality checks (longest ride vs race duration)
  - Conservative pacing reminders
  - Aggressive fueling guidance
  - Countdown to race
  - Race execution guidance

### Rest Day Limits
- All rest days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday):
  - Fine to ride if desired
  - Max 1 hour
  - Max 30 TSS

## Week Structure

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Monday:** Rest with week preview + reality check + rest day note
- **Tuesday:** Quality session (G-Spot or Threshold)
- **Wednesday:** Rest
- **Thursday:** Quality session (G-Spot or Threshold)
- **Friday:** Rest
- **Saturday:** Key session (longest ride of week, mixed intensity)
- **Sunday:** Rest or optional easy spin

## Emergency Considerations

### Reality Checks
- **Total Training Hours:** 13.75-22.5 hours over 6 weeks
- **Longest Ride:** 2 hours (Week 3 Saturday)
- **Race Duration:** Likely 4-8+ hours
- **Gap:** Large gap between training and race demands

### What This Means:
1. **Start Conservatively:** You don't have endurance to recover from going out hard
2. **Fuel Aggressively:** From mile 1 (50-60g carbs/hour minimum, more if you can)
3. **Accept Final Hours:** Will hurt more than training prepared you for - mental toughness matters
4. **Ego Has No Place:** You're underprepared - race accordingly

### What Works:
- G-Spot/Threshold training is time-efficient
- You build enough power to sustain race effort
- Conservative pacing strategy gets you home
- Aggressive fueling covers endurance gaps

### What You Learn:
- Training volume matters—you felt it in final hours
- You can survive on minimal prep with smart execution
- Next time: start training earlier
- Emergency plans work, but they're not optimal

## Template Statistics

- **Total weeks:** 6
- **Total workouts:** 42 (6 weeks × 7 workouts)
- **File size:** ~35KB JSON
- **Structure:** Complete with all workout descriptions and ZWO blocks

## Usage with Cursor AI

To generate a race-specific plan:

1. **Load template:**
   ```
   Load: current/plans/4. Ayahuasca Save My Race (6 weeks)/template.json
   Load: current/guidelines/nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
   ```

2. **Provide race-specific considerations:**
   ```
   Race: [RACE NAME]
   - Heat training needed (if applicable)
   - Aggressive fueling: 50-60g carbs/hour minimum
   - Conservative pacing reminders
   - Mental toughness guidance
   ```

3. **Cursor will generate:**
   - Modified Python script
   - 42 ZWO files
   - Modifications document

## Emergency Plan Principles

### Time-Efficient Training
- **G-Spot (87-92% FTP):** Builds threshold power without excessive fatigue
- **Threshold (95-100% FTP):** Race pace intensity
- **No Junk Miles:** Every minute on the bike counts
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to finish strong than blow up

### Conservative Race Execution
- **Start Easy:** Way easier than you think
- **Fuel From Mile 1:** 50-60g carbs/hour minimum
- **Accept Reality:** You're underprepared - ego has no place
- **Mental Toughness:** Final hours will hurt - everyone's do, but yours will hurt more

### Post-Race Reflection
- **What Worked:** G-Spot/Threshold training, conservative pacing, aggressive fueling
- **What You Learned:** Training volume matters, you can survive on minimal prep
- **Next Steps:** If you want to RACE (not just finish), you need 12+ weeks minimum

## Next Steps

Once complete (all 6 weeks), this template can be used like other emergency plans:
- Load template.json
- Load nutrition_hydration_guidelines.json
- Apply race-specific modifications
- Generate race-specific plan

**Remember:** 6-week emergency plans work for FINISHING. Not for performing. Not for enjoying. For surviving. You survived. Well done.
