  <name>W02 Tue - G-Spot Progression</name>
  <description>• STRUCTURE: 15 min warmup → 3x12 min @ 87-92% FTP (4 min easy between) → 10 min cooldown • Longer intervals than Week 1. This should feel hard but sustainable. You're building the engine. Control your breathing, stay smooth. If form breaks, end the interval early—quality over quantity. • CADENCE WORK: Mix cadences—interval 1 high cadence (100+ rpm), interval 2 low cadence (40-60 rpm), interval 3 self-selected.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - HYDRATION:
&lt;90 min (any intensity): 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes mandatory. Before hard efforts, take 1 gel. Light urine color (not clear) = well hydrated.

• UNBOUND GRAVEL 200 - DAILY BASELINE HYDRATION:
Start day hydrated: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast. Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium. Aim for light urine color (not clear).</description>
