## UNBOUND 200-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS

### 1. Heat Training Protocol (Weeks 2-5, All Quality Sessions)

**Implementation:**
- Heat training notes added to all quality sessions (hard intervals, threshold work, VO2max, G-Spot) in Weeks 2-5
- Three-tier system based on week type and athlete readiness:
  - **Tier 1 (Better Than Nothing):** Recovery week (4)
    - Protocol: 10-12 min hot shower post-ride
    - Effect: Maintains heat adaptations, minimal stress
  - **Tier 2 (Good):** Medium weeks (5)
    - Protocol: 20-40 min Z2 indoor with reduced airflow OR 10-15 min sauna/hot bath post-ride
    - Effect: Measurable heat adaptation, raises plasma volume
  - **Tier 3 (Ideal - High Impact):** Load weeks (2, 3)
    - Protocol: 45-75 min Z2 with minimized cooling + 15-25 min sauna/hot bath post-ride
    - Effect: Maximal heat adaptation, big plasma volume gains, noticeable RPE reductions

**Rationale:**
Unbound 200 is "basically always hot," and competitive athletes in a 6-week emergency plan need aggressive heat adaptation. The three-tier system ensures maximum adaptation during concentrated loading blocks (Weeks 2-3) while respecting recovery needs.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Rapid heat acclimatization in compressed timeframe
- Plasma volume expansion improves cardiovascular efficiency
- Lower perceived exertion in hot conditions = better pacing decisions
- Three-tier system respects recovery during concentrated loading

### 2. Aggressive Carbohydrate Fueling (All Long Rides)

**Implementation:**
- Fueling notes added to all long rides (4+ hours)
- Target: 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on dress rehearsal)
- Emphasis on "training your gut aggressively"
- Practice race-day nutrition products from Week 1

**Rationale:**
Unbound 200 is a "long day" and some athletes don't train their gut, so their "fuel tank basically can't hang." Competitive athletes in emergency plans need aggressive fueling—race day isn't the time to discover your stomach can't handle 80g carbs/hour.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Gut adaptation to high carbohydrate intake in compressed timeframe
- Race-day confidence in fueling strategy
- Reduced risk of bonking in final hours
- Better performance through consistent energy availability

---

### 3. Dress Rehearsal: 9-Hour "Blow Out Day" (Week 3 Saturday)

**Implementation:**
- Week 3 Saturday modified from original workout to full 9-hour dress rehearsal (all three block options)
- Structure: 3 hours Z2 → Rhythm intervals (hour 4) → 2 hours Z2 with fueling practice → Loaded intervals (hour 7) → 2 hours Z2 to finish
- Clear instruction: "CLEAR YOUR SCHEDULE"
- Emphasis on testing EVERYTHING: nutrition, hydration, clothing, bike setup, tire pressure

**Rationale:**
Unbound is "logistic/adventure loaded with not great support." This 9-hour ride (~3 weeks before race) is the equivalent of a "blow out day" where athletes practice all race-day logistics, not just fitness. For Competitors, this is critical preparation.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Logistics practice (bottle handoffs, eating while riding, pacing)
- Mental preparation for long day
- Equipment and nutrition validation
- Confidence from completing 9-hour effort
- For Competitors, "this 9-hour ride is worth 15 shorter rides for race prep"

---

### 4. Robust Taper (Week 6)

**Implementation:**
- Volume reduced 50-60% in Week 6
- Intensity maintained for sharpness
- Taper notes added to all workouts Week 6
- Emphasis: "Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race"

**Rationale:**
"You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well." Competitive athletes in emergency plans need maximum freshness—after 5 weeks of concentrated loading, recovery is critical.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Maximum freshness for 200-mile effort
- Preserved fitness with reduced fatigue
- Better race-day execution through recovery
- Optimal performance after compressed training block

---

### 5. Gravel Grit Integration (Week 6 Race Day)

**Implementation:**
- Gravel Grit mental training note added to Week 6 Saturday and Sunday race day workouts
- Message: "You've trained your mind to push through discomfort. Trust that training."

**Rationale:**
The Gravel Grit program helps athletes mentally prepare to push themselves that hard. Unbound 200 requires deep mental toughness, especially in the final hours after a compressed 6-week build.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Mental preparation for suffering
- Confidence in ability to push through discomfort
- Better decision-making when fatigued
- "Mental toughness is the difference between finishing and performing at your best"

---

### 6. Hydration Protocol (All Workouts)

**Implementation:**
- Daily baseline hydration notes on all workouts:
  - Start day: ~500 ml water + 500-1000 mg sodium with breakfast
  - Pre-ride (60 min before): 500 ml fluid + 300-600 mg sodium
- During-workout hydration based on duration and intensity:
  - <90 min: 1 bottle/hr with electrolytes
  - >90 min low intensity: 60g carbs/hr, 1-1.5 bottles/hr, 600-1200 mg sodium/hr
  - >90 min high intensity: 90g carbs/hr, 1.5 bottles/hr minimum, 1000-1500 mg sodium/hr

**Rationale:**
Proper hydration is foundational for heat adaptation and performance. Competitive athletes in emergency plans need systematic hydration to support heat training and long-day performance.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Optimal hydration status for training and racing
- Better heat tolerance through proper electrolyte balance
- Reduced risk of dehydration-related performance decline
- Systematic approach prevents guesswork

---

### 7. Cadence Work & Changing Pace Philosophy (All Intervals)

**Implementation:**
- Cadence work instructions added to all quality sessions
- Base period: Alternate high cadence (100+ rpm, seated) and low cadence (40-60 rpm, seated)
- Build period: Rhythm intervals (2 min Z3 self-selected + 1 min Z4 high cadence) and Loaded intervals (1 min Z5/Z6 high cadence surge → 14 min Z3 self-selected)
- Cadence ranges added to interval blocks where possible

**Rationale:**
"Changing pace is fundamental to cycling." Training the neuromuscular skill to produce power in different ways (high cadence, low cadence) lays the foundation for race-specific pacing. Rhythm and Loaded intervals train how racing actually happens—you're never jumping cleanly from Z2 to threshold in races.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- Neuromuscular skill to change pace effectively
- Race-specific pacing patterns
- Better handling of surges and recoveries
- More efficient power production across cadence ranges

---

### 8. G-Spot Terminology (Replaces Sweet Spot)

**Implementation:**
- All "Sweet Spot" references replaced with "G-Spot"
- Intensity range updated from 88-93% FTP (Sweet Spot) to 87-92% FTP (G-Spot)
- Workout names updated (e.g., "Sweet Spot Volume" → "G-Spot Volume")

**Rationale:**
G-Spot (Gravel Spot) is the actual intensity at which most athletes end up riding at a sustained pace in gravel races—1% lower on both low and high end than Sweet Spot. This is more accurate for gravel racing demands.

**Athlete Benefits:**
- More accurate training intensity for gravel racing
- Better specificity to race demands
- Improved pacing decisions based on actual race intensity

## PLAN GUIDE DESCRIPTION

### How This Plan Was Modified for Unbound 200

This COMPETE SAVE MY RACE plan has been specifically modified to address the unique demands of Unbound 200 while respecting the compressed 6-week emergency format. The modifications fall into five key areas:

**1. Heat Adaptation:** Unbound is "basically always hot," and competitive athletes in emergency plans need aggressive heat adaptation. A three-tier heat training protocol (Better Than Nothing, Good, Ideal) has been integrated into all quality sessions Weeks 2-5, with Tier 3 (Ideal) applied during concentrated loading blocks (Weeks 2-3) for maximum adaptation.

**2. Aggressive Fueling:** Unbound's long day requires aggressive gut training. All long rides emphasize 60-90g carbs/hour (up to 100g on the dress rehearsal), ensuring your stomach can handle race-day fueling demands. Competitive athletes need this aggressive fueling—race day isn't the time to discover your stomach can't handle 80g carbs/hour.

**3. Dress Rehearsal:** Week 3 Saturday is your 9-hour "blow out day"—clear your schedule. This is logistics practice, fueling practice, heat practice, and mental preparation all in one. For Competitors, this 9-hour ride is worth 15 shorter rides for race prep. Test EVERYTHING: nutrition, hydration, clothing, bike setup, tire pressure.

**4. Robust Taper:** Freshness/form counts for A LOT in this race. You don't want to show up half-cooked when you're going to go so deep in the well. Volume drops significantly Week 6, but intensity stays sharp. After 5 weeks of concentrated loading, recovery is critical for competitive performance.

**5. Gravel Grit Integration:** The Gravel Grit mental training program helps prepare you mentally to push yourself that hard. When it gets hard in the final hours, remember: everyone hurts. Who handles it better? That's you. Mental toughness is the difference between finishing and performing at your best.

**Additional Enhancements:**
- **Hydration Protocol:** Systematic daily baseline hydration and during-workout hydration based on duration and intensity
- **Cadence Work:** All intervals include cadence variation (high/low) to train changing pace—fundamental skill for gravel racing
- **Rhythm/Loaded Intervals:** Week 5 (sharpening) includes race-specific pacing patterns (Rhythm: alternating Z3/Z4, Loaded: Z5/Z6 surge → Z3)
- **G-Spot Terminology:** All "Sweet Spot" references replaced with "G-Spot" (87-92% FTP) for gravel-specific accuracy

These modifications not only meet the unique demands of Unbound 200 but serve the competitive athlete in a compressed timeframe by:
- Maximizing adaptation in minimal time (aggressive heat training, concentrated loading)
- Building race-specific skills quickly (cadence work, rhythm/loaded intervals)
- Ensuring logistics are dialed (9-hour dress rehearsal)
- Preserving freshness for race day (robust taper)

You've trained smart with block periodization in a compressed format. Trust your preparation. Execute.

## TECHNICAL NOTES

- **G-Spot Terminology:** This plan uses "G-Spot" (87-92% FTP) instead of "Sweet Spot" (88-93% FTP). G-Spot is the actual intensity at which most athletes end up riding at a sustained pace in gravel races—1% lower on both low and high end than Sweet Spot.

- **Block Options:** Weeks 2-3 have three block options (VO2max, Threshold, Durability). All three are generated—choose ONE based on your Week 1 assessment. Delete the other two block options before uploading to TrainingPeaks.

- **Dress Rehearsal:** Week 3 Saturday is modified to a 9-hour dress rehearsal for ALL three block options. This ensures logistics practice regardless of which limiter you're targeting.

- **Cadence Ranges:** Cadence work is integrated into all intervals. TrainingPeaks structured workout builder supports cadence ranges, which are included in interval blocks where possible.
