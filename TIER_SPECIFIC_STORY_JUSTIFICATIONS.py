So instead of pretending those 4 hours can magically become 12, this plan makes every single one of them count. Quality over quantity isn't a compromise here. It's the only strategy that works.""",

        """Most plans for {race_name} are written for people with 12+ hours a week. The {plan_name} isn't. Cramming high-volume training into a low-volume week doesn't make you faster—it makes you tired. The workouts here are designed for maximum adaptation with minimum time. Every session has a purpose. None of them assume you have hours to waste.""",

You won't match someone training 15 hours weekly. But you'll build enough to finish—if every session targets what matters most. High-quality intervals, strategic recovery, race-specific skills. Everything else is optional.""",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        """This plan isn't designed to get you on a podium. It's designed to get you across the line feeling like you raced, not survived. That requires a specific training approach: sessions short enough to recover from, intense enough to create change, and focused enough to build the skills Unbound actually demands. Most plans ignore this because they're template workouts scaled down. This one was built from scratch for your constraints.""",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        """This plan is for people 50+ with limited hours. Recovery isn't optional anymore. Your body needs longer adaptation windows. This plan maximizes efficiency while respecting that reality. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. The difference between finishing and breaking at your age isn't more volume—it's smarter recovery. Every session counts because recovery takes longer.""",

Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training decisions. The plan builds you up without breaking you down. Recovery becomes the primary training variable, not an afterthought.""",

You get systematic preparation, not guesswork.""",

The {plan_name} builds them. Heat adaptation weeks 6-10. Distance fueling tested. Mental preparation practiced. Everything validated before race day.""",

But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan is designed to unlock it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.""",
        
        # Variation 2: The structure revelation
        """Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. It's for people who want their fitness to show up predictably, not accidentally. The training zones are scientific but simple. The workout progression is systematic but flexible. The result is performance that arrives when you need it—not when luck decides.""",

It's built to create race-day capacity, not training-day heroics.""",
