SOLUTION_STATE_OPENINGS = {
    "ayahuasca": [
        # Variation 1: The math reality
        "You have 4 hours a week. Unbound Gravel 200 takes 10-14 hours to finish. The math doesn't work. You know that. You're doing it anyway. This plan doesn't pretend those 4 hours magically become 12. It makes every single one of them count.",
        
        # Variation 2: The dream acknowledgment  
        "Most training plans assume 10+ hours per week. You've got 4-5. Maybe 6 if the planets align. That doesn't make you less serious—it makes your training decisions more important. This plan is built for people who know the odds but show up regardless.",
        
        # Variation 3: The efficiency angle (reality-grounded)
        "You won't build the fitness of someone training 15 hours. But you'll build enough—if every workout counts. Limited hours means compromises. This plan makes those decisions: what matters most, what you can skip. Four hours won't match someone doing 15. But it's enough to finish—if you use those hours right.",
        
        # Variation 4: The recognition
        "You're making this work around a life, not building a life around this. The training here respects that reality. Every workout is essential. Every rest day is strategic. No filler. No fluff. No cramming 12-hour plans into 4-hour weeks and hoping it works.",
        
        # Variation 5: The wink
        "Everyone says 'train smarter, not harder' when they mean 'just ride more.' This plan actually delivers: intensity that creates adaptation, skills that prevent disasters, recovery that lets you absorb the work. It's built for limited hours and unlimited determination.",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        "You're 50+ with limited hours. Recovery isn't optional anymore. This plan maximizes efficiency while respecting longer adaptation timelines. The difference between finishing and breaking at your age isn't more volume—it's smarter recovery. Every session counts because recovery takes longer.",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        "You're 45+ making this work around a life. Your body needs longer recovery windows. This plan respects that. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training decisions."
    ],
    
    "finisher": [
        # Variation 1: The leveling moment
        "You've finished events before. You know you can do the distance. But you also know there's another gear you're not finding. This plan unlocks it—not through more volume, but through better structure. The difference between finishing and competing isn't more hours. It's better hours.",
        
        # Variation 2: The structure revelation
        "Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally. Training zones are scientific but simple. Workout progression is systematic but flexible. Performance arrives when you need it.",
        
        # Variation 3: The capacity building
        "Finishing Unbound and racing Unbound require different engines. Finishing takes endurance. Racing takes power you can repeat for 10+ hours. This plan builds both—in the right order, in the right proportions. Base isn't just riding. Intensity isn't just suffering.",
        
        # Variation 4: The consistency angle
        "The 8-12 hour range gives you flexibility without chaos. Every week has clear priorities. Every session has obvious intent. The structure does the thinking so you can do the training. That's what turns occasional fitness into race-ready performance.",
        
        # Variation 5: The specificity defense
        "This isn't a generic century plan with 'gravel' stuck on top. It's designed for variable-pace racing on rough terrain. Technical skills. Fueling protocols that work when you're getting rattled. Power distribution strategies for 10+ hour efforts. This plan is built for what Unbound actually demands.",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        "You're 45. Recovery isn't optional anymore. This plan builds you up without breaking you down. The difference between finishing and competing at your age isn't more volume—it's smarter recovery. Every session respects your adaptation timeline. Every rest day is strategic. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs better training.",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        "You're 50+. Your body needs longer recovery windows. Your training needs to respect that. This plan uses moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. The difference between thriving and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training more deliberately. Recovery becomes the primary training variable.",
        
        # Variation 8: The progression clarity
        "You've been training consistently but results aren't improving. The problem isn't effort—it's progression. This plan shows you exactly how to build fitness systematically. Base phase creates durability. Build phase adds power. Peak phase sharpens performance. Each phase has clear goals and measurable outcomes. No more wondering if you're doing it right.",
        
        # Variation 9: The race-readiness angle
        "Finishing events is one thing. Racing them is another. This plan builds race-readiness, not just fitness. Structured taper that peaks performance. Fueling protocols tested in training. Pacing strategies for variable terrain. Technical skills for rough conditions. Everything here prepares you to execute on race day, not just survive it.",
        
        # Variation 10: The systematic build
        "You've been training consistently but results aren't improving. The problem isn't effort—it's progression. This plan shows you exactly how to build fitness systematically. Base phase creates durability. Build phase adds power. Peak phase sharpens performance. Each phase has clear goals and measurable outcomes. No more wondering if you're doing it right."
    ],
    
    "compete": [
        # Variation 1: The performance gap
        "You're training 12-18 hours. You're doing the work. But something's not translating to race day. Usually it's one of three things: wrong intensity distribution, poor pacing strategy, or mismatched taper protocol. This plan addresses all three.",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        "Most people at your volume level are training hard—but not smart. Every session here has a specific adaptation target. Every week balances stress and recovery with precision. The difference between top-20% and top-5% isn't more suffering—it's better targeting.",
        
        # Variation 3: The plateau breaker
        "Same training, same results, can't figure out why the next level won't arrive. The answer: your training stopped challenging your current fitness. This plan uses progressive overload correctly—not just adding volume, but strategically increasing demands where they create adaptation.",
        
        # Variation 4: The race execution angle  
        "Most competitors at Unbound have similar fitness. The winners know how to deploy it. Pacing strategy. Fueling under fatigue. Mental protocols when it hurts. This plan builds both the engine and the driver.",
        
        # Variation 5: The methodology defense
        "Polarized training principles work for time-crunched competitive athletes. You get enough volume to build durability, enough intensity to sharpen performance, and enough recovery to absorb both. No junk miles. No hero intervals. Just systematic progression toward a specific performance target.",
        
        # Variation 6: Masters-specific
        "You're 45+. Training at 12-18 hours requires different recovery protocols than it did at 30. This plan acknowledges that. Recovery windows are longer. Adaptation timelines are respected. The difference between competing and breaking at your age isn't training less—it's training with age-appropriate recovery. Every session counts because recovery takes longer.",
        
        # Variation 7: Masters-specific
        "You're 50+. Your body adapts slower. Your recovery needs are different. This plan respects that reality. Moderate volume with strategic intensity—enough to create adaptation, enough rest to absorb it. Age isn't a limitation—it's data that informs smarter training. The difference between thriving and breaking isn't less work—it's better recovery architecture.",
        
        # Variation 8: The execution gap
        "You've got the fitness. You've done the training. But race day execution keeps falling apart. Pacing mistakes. Fueling failures. Mental breakdowns when it gets hard. This plan addresses the gap between training fitness and racing fitness. The workouts build the engine. The protocols teach you to drive it.",
        
        # Variation 9: The systematic approach
        "Random training at 12-18 hours creates random results. This plan eliminates the guesswork. Every week has a purpose. Every session targets a specific adaptation. The progression is systematic, not accidental. You'll know why you're doing each workout and how it builds toward race day. That clarity creates confidence."
    ],
    
    "podium": [
        # Variation 1: The coaching moment
        "You've been your own coach long enough. You know how to train. You know your body. But self-coaching has blind spots—especially recovery management and taper execution. This plan gives you the structure to stay disciplined when your instincts say to do more.",
        
        # Variation 2: The precision angle
        "Most plans at 18+ hours just add more work. This one adds more precision. At this volume, training quality determines results—not quantity. Every session has a specific purpose. Every recovery day is strategic. The difference between podium and pack is who trains most intelligently over 12 weeks without breaking.",
        
        # Variation 3: The competitive edge
        "Unbound podiums are decided by details: who nailed heat adaptation, who got fueling dialed, who stayed disciplined through taper instead of panicking. You've got the engine. This plan gives you the execution protocols that separate top-10 from top-3.",
        
        # Variation 4: The methodology defense
        "This plan balances polarized intensity with race-specific demands. You need sustainable power (Zone 2 base), repeatable efforts (threshold work), and explosive capacity (VO2max sessions). Most high-volume plans just pile on endurance. This one builds a complete athlete.",
        
        # Variation 5: The reality check
        "This plan wasn't built for people hoping to podium—it was built for people expecting to. That requires a different standard: no missed sessions, no half-effort intervals, no 'close enough' on fueling protocols. The plan is structured, but execution is on you."
