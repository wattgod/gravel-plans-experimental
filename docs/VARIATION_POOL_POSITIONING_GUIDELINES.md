# VARIATION POOL POSITIONING GUIDELINES
# ======================================
# These rules ensure variations maintain tier-appropriate positioning
# and Sultanic beat/contrast psychology

## CRITICAL POSITIONING PRINCIPLES

### 1. OPENING LINE REQUIREMENTS

**Every opening must:**
- Address the CORE CONCERN of the tier/level it serves
- Use beat/contrast Sultanic psychology
- Include a slight wink or droll observation
- Create self-selection (excite or intimidate, not ambivalent)

**Tier-Specific Core Concerns:**

**AYAHUASCA (0-5 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: "I don't have time but want to do this anyway"
- Beat: Most people think you need 15 hours. You have 4.
- Contrast: This works with your constraints, not against them
- Wink: "Limited hours, unlimited determination"

**FINISHER (8-12 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: "I want predictable results, not random fitness"
- Beat: Most recreational riders train randomly
- Contrast: This plan makes fitness show up predictably
- Wink: "Stop surviving, start racing"

**COMPETE (12-18 hrs/week):**
- Core concern: "I'm serious but hitting a ceiling"
- Beat: You know there's another gear
- Contrast: Volume alone doesn't unlock it
- Wink: "Done guessing why the next level won't arrive"

**PODIUM (18+ hrs/week):**
- Core concern: "Details separate me from the competition"
- Beat: Pack fitness vs podium fitness
- Contrast: Most plans treat these the same
- Wink: "Details separate podium from pack"

**Experience Levels Within Tiers:**
- **Beginner:** Less experience, more guidance needed
- **Intermediate:** Some experience, wants refinement
- **Advanced:** High experience, wants precision
- **Masters:** Age-appropriate concerns (recovery, adaptation)

### 2. FEATURES MUST SUPPORT CORE CONCERN

**Feature selection should align with tier's problem:**

**Ayahuasca features emphasize:**
- Time efficiency
- Simplicity
- "Doing it anyway" attitude
- Minimal but sufficient

**Finisher features emphasize:**
- Predictability
- Structure
- Consistency
- Removing guesswork

**Compete features emphasize:**
- Precision
- Progressive overload
- Breaking through plateaus
- Systems at volume

**Podium features emphasize:**
- Execution precision
- Marginal gains
- Competitive edge
- Elite-level details

### 3. RACE-SPECIFIC CUSTOMIZATION

**Every description must reflect the SPECIFIC race it's for:**
- Unbound 200: Heat, distance, Kansas terrain
- Belgian Waffle Ride: Technical, climbing, varied surfaces
- Mid South: Mud, weather variability, Oklahoma conditions

**Forbidden:**
- Generic "gravel race" language
- Copy that could apply to any race
- Missing race-specific demands

**Required:**
- Race name mentioned 2-3 times
- Specific challenges called out (heat, mud, climbing, etc.)
- Race-specific protocols (heat adaptation for Unbound, mud handling for Mid South)

**RACE NAME REFERENCE RULES (Natural Language, Not Keyword Stuffing):**

**First Mention:**
- Use full formal name: "Unbound Gravel 200"
- Establishes context and specificity

**Subsequent Mentions:**
- Use natural shorthand: "Unbound", "the race", "this race"
- Avoid repeating full formal name 3+ times (sounds like keyword stuffing)
- Mix formal and informal references naturally

**Examples:**

✅ **GOOD (Natural flow):**
- "Most plans treat Unbound Gravel 200 like any other race. This one doesn't. Built for Unbound's heat, distance, and Kansas terrain—the race demands precision."
- "Unbound Gravel 200 requires different preparation. This plan delivers it. Race day won't surprise you."

❌ **BAD (Keyword stuffing):**
- "Unbound Gravel 200 is challenging. This plan prepares you for Unbound Gravel 200. Unbound Gravel 200 demands heat adaptation. Unbound Gravel 200 requires..."
- (Full name repeated 4+ times = robotic, keyword-stuffed)

**Why this matters:**
- Natural language reads better
- Keyword stuffing breaks flow and sounds robotic
- First mention establishes context, shorthand maintains readability
- Still achieves race-specific positioning without repetition

### 4. TIER/LEVEL MENTIONS IN BODY COPY

**Requirement:**
- Full plan designation (tier + level) must appear at least ONCE in body copy
- Not just tier alone or hours alone
- Reader should see THEIR SPECIFIC PLAN named

**Examples:**
✅ "The **Finisher Beginner** plan builds consistency..."
✅ "As a **Compete Advanced** athlete, precision matters..."
✅ "This **Ayahuasca Beginner** program works with constraints..."
✅ "Built for **Finisher Intermediate Masters** athletes 45+..."

**NOT sufficient (too generic):**
❌ "At 8-12 hours per week..." (just tier hours)
❌ "Finisher tier athletes..." (no level specified)
❌ "This plan works for beginners..." (no tier specified)

**Why this matters:**
- Self-identification: "This is MY plan"
- Specificity: Not just any finisher plan, but THE beginner one
- Positioning: Tier + level creates exact targeting

**Where to include:**
- Opening paragraph (ideal)
- Story/justification section
- Value prop boxes
- Anywhere discussing the plan's approach

### 5. BEAT/CONTRAST PSYCHOLOGY (SULTANIC)

**Structure:**
1. **Beat:** State the common approach (often wrong)
2. **Contrast:** Show how this plan differs
3. **Payoff:** Explain the benefit

**Example:**
Beat: "Most recreational riders train randomly"
Contrast: "This plan breaks that pattern"
Payoff: "Your fitness shows up predictably, not accidentally"

**Characteristics:**
- Direct (no hedging)
- Reality-grounded (not aspirational BS)
- Slight edge/wink
- Creates self-selection

### 6. TONE: SLIGHT WINK, DROLL OBSERVATION

**What this means:**
- Not aggressive or mean
- Not overly serious or preachy
- Knowing nod to reality
- Dry humor where appropriate

**Examples:**
✅ "Limited hours and unlimited determination"
✅ "Done guessing why the next level won't arrive"
✅ "Details separate podium from pack"
✅ "Stop surviving and start racing"

❌ "You will DOMINATE this race!" (too aggressive)
❌ "Train smarter, not harder" (cliché, no personality)
❌ "Are you ready to unlock your potential?" (generic coach-speak)

- [ ] Contrasts with generic/wrong approaches
- [ ] Maintains Matti voice (direct, reality-grounded)
- [ ] Mentions tier/level at least once

**Race-Specific:**
- [ ] References actual race demands
- [ ] Not interchangeable with other races
- [ ] Includes race-specific protocols where relevant

**Tone:**
- [ ] Direct but not aggressive

## EXAMPLES: GOOD VS BAD

### AYAHUASCA OPENING

**❌ BAD (Generic, no beat/contrast):**
"This plan is designed for busy athletes with limited time who still want to complete gravel races."

**✅ GOOD (Beat/contrast, wink):**
"Most people think you need 15 hours a week to finish Unbound. You have 4. This plan works with your constraints, not against them—limited hours, unlimited determination."

### FINISHER OPENING

**❌ BAD (No positioning, vague):**
"Progressive training system that helps recreational riders improve their performance."

**✅ GOOD (Beat/contrast, tier-specific):**
"Most recreational riders train randomly: hard when they feel good, easy when they don't. This plan breaks that pattern. Your fitness will show up predictably, not accidentally."

### COMPETE OPENING

**❌ BAD (Generic, no edge):**
"High-volume training plan for serious competitive athletes looking to improve."

**✅ GOOD (Beat/contrast, direct):**
"You know there's another gear you're not finding. Training 12-18 hours should unlock it. Volume alone doesn't—this plan does."

## IMPLEMENTATION

**When writing new variations:**
1. Identify the tier and its core concern
2. Start with beat/contrast structure
3. Add slight wink or droll observation
4. Ensure features support the core concern
5. Check tone maintains Matti voice
6. Verify tier/level mentioned in body
7. Confirm race-specific customization

**When reviewing variations:**
1. Read opening → Does it address tier concern?
2. Check features → Do they support positioning?
3. Verify tone → Direct, slight wink, reality-grounded?
4. Count tier mentions → At least 1 in body copy?
5. Check race specificity → Could this be any race?

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**These guidelines maintain:**
- Tier-appropriate positioning
- Sultanic beat/contrast psychology
- Self-selection (not generic appeal)
- Race-specific value
- Matti voice consistency

**Without these guidelines:**
- Copy becomes generic
- Tiers become interchangeable
- Positioning weakens
- Self-selection fails
- Brand voice dilutes

**Every variation should pass this checklist before being added to pools.**
